A day in the life of a startup is highly variable, so I'm going to answer according to the stages of progress we've experienced at Happy Grasshopper.  In every stage, our whole team is pretty much always working.  This can be a significant stress to loved ones, who have to put up with lies like "I'll be home in 30 minutes" and "we're almost there".Personally, I'm up at 5:30am M-F, in the office by 7:00 and am generally there until 6pm.  My co-founder is up later, arrives about 10am and stays until...honestly, I'm not sure and it doesn't really matter because as I already mentioned, we're always working.  There is a nearly constant flow of black coffee and frozen, easy to eat at the desk food.After I get home, hang with my wife and kids, I generally check email, jot down ideas and do supplementary reading until I crash at about 11pm.  This has been my schedule for years, although what I actually get to focus on day to day varies widely according to the stage of our progress.In addition to this, there's travel, emergency situations and the occasional all night sprint.Pre-pre - This was before HG was an idea, a product or a company.  I was fully engaged as CEO of another somewhat shaky startup that provided a white label CRM tool that featured fully integrated email marketing sequences that auto-fired as a contact matured through the customer life-cycle.We sold to the franchise and business opportunity segment, who purchased our tool specifically for its ability to automate email marketing.  We discovered customer pain centered around content development - we provided the megaphone, but they didn't know what to say.  Smelled like opportunity.The typical day at this point was very similar to those who start thinking about starting a company while working a day job.  This is a stressful but exciting time where the new opportunity is never fully out of your thinking.Discovery - Okay, so we had an idea, big deal.  Millions of those go nowhere.  If we were going to commit to this we needed some very quick and dirty validation.  We quickly put up a website that made it appear as if our service was fully automated.  In reality, we were prepared to manually do everything behind the scenes.This is a really fun time in the process.  It's full of design, wonderful discussions and key decisions.  This or that?  Now or later?  It is also a very short time, less than a week in our case.With our site done it was time to test the market.  This is what it's all about.  We decided to offer one plan - $19/mo with a 30-day free trial.  Would people sign up?  Would they pay?  Would they even notice?I spent my days reaching out to sales trainers and asking them to try our product.  A few of them immediately recommended it to their students and we started to take this very seriously.Development / Formal Validation - This is really late "discovery" phase.  We had about 15 paying customers who seemed pretty happy and we knew that our site would have to actually automate the process or we'd never scale.  At this point, we're also fumbling around with how to talk about our service.  We're honing elevator speeches and value propositions and being surprised by what our customers have to say about us.This is also a very fun, stressful time.  As the funder/founder, it's my goal to invest the smallest amount of money and time in any new venture.  Because I am literally putting my ability to pay for private school, horseback riding lessons and all the other things that I want to provide my family at risk, I become very focused on determining our ability to scale.  After all, it's one thing to know there's a market, it's another thing to know you can build something that will serve it.  We quickly built out the automation and set about adding hundreds of new customers with the aim of discovering the sort of issues that don't show up when you're serving a few customers, but whack you in the face when you have 1,000's.Our days at this point we're shared between UX design, coding and marketing functions.  We're talented generalists at HG and each of us contribute everywhere.  This was all well informed by on-going input from our growing customer base.  We would enjoy the occasional elation of a big win and the heart-wrenching, gut burning panic of "what?", "how'd that break?", "that shouldn't have broken".We started blogging and pursuing press coverage.  More and more of my day becomes occupied by this.  We're also starting to have enough customers to have a support responsibility that needs to be managed.During this time, we introduced a totally free account option and signed up our 1,000th customer.  We had proven our ability to consistently provide value for our users in a scalable, dependable platform.  Validation? Check.  :)Traction - This is something you hear all the time.  Everybody seems to have traction...for me it means the day we become profitable is growing closer in a measurable, dependable way.  Our revenues have roughly doubled every month for the past 6 months, we've been featured in the national press and key influencers are starting to contact us.This is an incredible phase in the startup process.  We're ready to add the rocket fuel of outside capital and have a very attractive story to sell.  My focus is shifting to this as my team continues to normalize/optimize our internal and external processes.We're evaluating key hires and considering exactly how to invest the funds we'll raise, while also rapidly adding new customers, channel partners and continuing to refine our funnels.  Everyday is fun and the reward, for now, is the work itself.I'd love to have more to share...but this is our progress to date (and I've written more than enough already, right?).  :-)
