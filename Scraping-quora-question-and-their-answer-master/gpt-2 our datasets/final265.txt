Well, for the most part, I might have only had 3 classes per day. I think most classes were Mon-Wed-Fri, but a lot of classes were also Tues-Thurs. Even if you had a 100 percent course load, you might only have 2–3 classes in a day, or about 3 hours of actual instruction. However, those classes might be spread out with break in between, or you might have an extra lab/extra class you might have to attend.During any breaks, I would study, hang out with friends, or work. I often had an on campus job, and most let me work for a few hours here and there. This really helped lighten my load, as I could maybe work 4 hours a day over 2 or even 3 different periods, thus leaving the evening free for studying, personal time, or the occasional second job.That might sound cushy and easy, but make no mistakes; university students in Canada have to work for their degrees. For every class hour, you might have 2–3 hours of work you need to do. In language classes (where had 4–5 classes per week), we had weekly tests, recording assignments, manual writing and essays at some points, plus all your normal work and review. In another class, I might have to read a book inside of a week or two (I’m a slow reader), or might need to spend dozens of hours researching for a paper. In still another class, I might have a class-long presentation, so I’d need to create any materials and practice what I’m going to be talking about, which could be a week of work.Even if I only had 2 classes in a day, it wasn’t unusual for me to spend 8 hours on campus. Sure, there was some relaxation time, but students really do need that so they don’t go crazy. On a bad bad, I might have been on campus and working for almost 13 hours. Being a student can be really rough, so you really need to stay on top of things (which is why you have all that other work and review time earlier).
