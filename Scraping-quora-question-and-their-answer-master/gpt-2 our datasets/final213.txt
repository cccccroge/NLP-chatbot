It depends on the type of engineer you are and what industry you work for: Most engineers spend most of their day in an office in a mixture of meetings and private or semi-private work. Most of the other answers provide details as to what this may feel like. Many engineers also spend some portion of their time in a lab or production facility, which may be more or less interesting and more or less hands-on, again, depending on the industry. Many engineers travel to the field or to customers some portion of the time (up to 100% in some cases.) This can be very rewarding for people who enjoy travel and enjoy socializing with customers. It is hard on your health and on any sort of home life, but it can be a lot of fun and it pays very well. Even if you don't travel as a main portion of your job, some amount of travel to conferences or satellite offices is very common. It can be exciting or tedious depending on your personality and how often you do it.
