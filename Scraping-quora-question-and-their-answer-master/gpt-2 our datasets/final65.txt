Here is how a typical day would look like.Distribution of time spent in a day. No. of hours of sleep per night. The detailed analysis of the same is as below:Get up at 8:00 am or 8:30 am (depending on whether you want to have breakfast or not). The marginal utility analysis is carried out by every fachcha at some point during the year to calculate the marginal utility of a good morning meal against that of 30 more minutes of sleep. The various parameters considered are the number of hours already slept that night, the classes on that particular day etc.(Lifehack: In case of a boring class, it is better to sleep more and skip breakfast, which makes you more sleepy, in order to stay awake during the class and avoid being thrown out by the Professor for dozing off)Sprint and reach the classroom in time i.e by 8:45 am. (Under all circumstances, barring apocalypse and the Professor himself arriving late, the chances of both being roughly equal to 1 in a gazillion)Try and stay awake and try to make sense of the random sounds echoing in the classroom. (8:45 am to 1:10 pm)Lunch (1:10 to 1:30 pm)Surprise quiz notification (1:30 pm) (only on some days)From this point on, there is a fork in the timetable:Case 1: You have a quiz (Generally on days when you need sleep the most or you are not expecting one)Case 2: No quiz (#smalljoys)1:30 pm- 2:45 pmCase 1: Study for the quiz (What should be done)Scavenge the campus for people asking them what portion would come in the quiz, what sort of questions to expect, asking for a spare calculator etc. (What actually happens)Case 2:Sleep and praise the Lord for his mercy2:45 pm to 3:30 pmCase 1: Try and understand the question in the paper. If all else fails, do an NPV analysis for a Finance quiz, STP and Porters' 5 force analysis for a Marketing quiz or come up with your own framework for a HR one.Case 2:Keep sleeping and dream of a better world where you had taken up your undergrad job offer.3:30 pm to time to sleep**Now both the timelines again converge. The following things need to be done and are done by people in various combinations:Study the cases and the accompanying reading material and solve them for the next day classes (recommended but rarely adhered to)Start studying for the subject you feel can have a quiz the next day (usually, a futile effort)Group meetings (ideally to work in a group and come up with the best solution, usually to indulge in the sadistic pleasure of seeing others' grind as much or more than you)Dinner (optional, with venues including the Mess, the college canteen or your room (for the super lazy, courtesy the room delivery service)The following things are optional:2nd dinner (when you have no idea what to do and how to do it)Watch a moviePlay a game and stay in shape (Yeah, really!)Have a life (Good luck!)**The time at which a fachcha goes to sleep depends on various factors and is usually between 3-6 am.
