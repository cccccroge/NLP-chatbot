I don’t know how typical for others, but for me I never really leave my work.I know how that sounds, but it’s amazing.I never feel like work is “work.” I go in each day, when I’m ready, last 5 years that’s meant between 10 and 1. I get there and improvise between reddit, thinking about code, and writing code. Sometimes I’m rescued from a slump by someone else asking me for help, and I get to break for giving guidance and waxing philosophical.In the time I’ve done this, I’ve come to believe that this is just how it feels to pursue the right thing. I gave up on two dreams before landing here, and even as well as it’s going I still would never call this living my dream.I think it’s just finding what you are predisposed to, and I highly recommend it. :great success:
