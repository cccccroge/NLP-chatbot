Everyone’s “normal” is very different, but personally, on a weekday, I wake up at 6:15 am, get myself ready, go to my college classes, return home between 1–4 pm, do homework/get organized/study, eat dinner, maybe watch a little TV at dinner, time up any loose ends, shower, go to bed. In between all of this, I also read the news, read questions and answers on Quora, go on YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, and contemplate my life and how I can make it better by making and assessing new goals.if we are talking about what we usually perceive as normal, I think for a student, that’s just about it, but you could throw in a job depending on the person. For an adult with a full time job, I think it’s wake up, go to their 9–5, take care of bills/children/pets/etc., dinner, TV, go to bed.
