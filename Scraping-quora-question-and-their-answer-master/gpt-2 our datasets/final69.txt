A typical day at IIM A passes differently depending on which stage of your IIM A stay are you in. For most of my friends, there were 5 parts to our IIM A journey: (Months are broad indicators, not precise ones)First 2 months: Forced discipline. Adhering to norms. Military style academic rigor. Surprise quizzes and pre-class case preparation becomes quite demanding in the beginning. Little socialization at the dorm level. First slot exam gets over.Then Talent night happens - Inter section bonding time! You make friends - all willing to unleash themselves after two months of rigor on campus. Next 3 months: You start becoming summer placement oriented. Competition and cooperation starts emerging in dorms, study groups and sections. You start feeling professional.Last 4–5 months of first year: You face too many assignments and group projects. Sleepless assignment submission nights galore. Parties begin as well. Group night outs increase. Rugged slots these are. You keep dragging till your actual summer time comes.First 3–4 months of second year: Lots of memories shared from summer internship. Juniors welcomed. Lots of fun and memories built. You start competing in contests and events in college and beyond. You become active in clubs committees activities, you take up Independent projects under professors or you go for an exchange program. Chill time overall. A good time to build your resume.Last 4–5 months of second year: Full focus on final placements. You prepare yourself well in study groups. Your resume shines by now. You grab some offers and the parties continue to flow. Fun and frolic times!Overall, a worthy experience for life :-)
