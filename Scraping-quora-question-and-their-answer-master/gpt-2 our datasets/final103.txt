If you are a systematic trading shop, it is rather boring. You wimply follow the system. Of course, there will be a set of people who will be testing and validating new trading strategies. If you are discretionary shop, you spend time talking to the Street, communicating through BBG, reading FT, talking to other players and then doing trades. And yes, there will be those mandatory conference calls to attend to.
