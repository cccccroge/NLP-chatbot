I donâ€™t know a lot about how a day of professional writer go. And I am not even a pro. but is on my way. Now if you want to know how my day pass by, I wake up, I break up, and I connect.What does this mean is, I wake up, break up my self with the distractions, and connect with my own. Sometimes it goes for like 14 hours a day, sometimes 10, sometimes even 5, but the thing is it goes and in the seas of sleeps never it dive.I enjoy my inner-self, my outer-self.Extras-There are days when I spend 10 hours for just a single line or paragraph.There are days when I research.There are days when I play my guitar.There are days when I play football, cricket, frisby.and there always will be.Peace \./
