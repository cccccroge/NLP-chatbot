9AM: Wake up, get out of bed, pull back my confederate flag curtains, open the window and yell abuse at our Cuban American gardener. Use the elliptical for half an hour.9:30: After finishing my cardio, my dry cleaner calls. They apologise, but they haven’t been able to get the blood out of one of the three white hooded robes I sent them. No worries, my sister/girlfriend can make me another one.10:00: Breakfast. Steak and eggs (made by my pregnant, barefoot, 14 year old girlfriend), washed down with four bottles of Natty Lite. Throw empty bottles into front yard. I watch Fox News, drooling over the female news anchors and pounding the table loudly and yelling approval every time Hannity says something. Spit tobacco juice continually onto the floor.10:30: Shower, shave, brush teeth. I’ve got to keep my mullet looking luxurious, and as I only have three teeth left I’d better enjoy them while they last. I’m wearing my standard clothing today: a pair of torn and filthy 44 inch waist jeans, and a shirt with a picture of George Lincoln Rockwell on it. Oh, and of course my MAGA hat.10:45: Time to head out. I make sure I’m fully armed. Two guns in shoulder holsters. Two in ankle holsters. Two in belt holsters. I get to my car, noting with approval that it is an extra polluting model. It’s a British car, which means it is less reliable, but it looks pretty, and more importantly, I refuse to drive any car not made and designed by English speaking white people.11: 00: Reach the mall, as I need to do some shopping. Refuse to be served by anyone who “looks a bit foreign”, sexually harass every woman in sight. The girlfriend’s birthday is coming soon, and I know she has her eye on a particular pair of Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. Ask the man assisting me suspiciously if Zanotti is “one of those evil Jews”, or if “the greasy wop is kinda overrated”.11:45: Finally make my purchase, and leave. Spit on a homeless man I see at the mall entrance. Offer him a dollar, then snatch it back as he tries to accept it.12:20: Get to the restaurant I’m meeting a friend at. See two men holding hands at a nearby table, lean over and tell them loudly that they’re damned to the eternal fires of hell. Sniff my food gingerly, and ask the waiters suspiciously if any Muslims work in the kitchen14:00: Get home. Have a quick nap in my bed, my arm wrapped around my AR-15.15:00: Wander over to the marina at the yacht club. It’s a gorgeous day and I’d like to take the boat out so I can dump my trash in the sea and watch a turtle choking to death on plastic.16:30: Still having fun on the boat drinking beer and yelling “wetback” or the n word at every hispanic person or African American I see on another boat. Admire my latest tattoo: a bible verse wrapped around Trump’s grinning face.16:45: Peckish. I get a can of spray cheese and spray it all down my throat in one sitting. It’s also great to use in bed with your partner.17:00: Still enjoying just messing around on the boat. I get a text from my friend, reminding me to bring my own cross to next week’s Klan meeting, because remember how embarrassing it was last time when I forgot to bring one.18:00: Return home, get ready for church. We’re having a prayer potluck down at the rifle range afterwards.20:30: Change clothes at home, read the paper. Laugh happily as I read about a school shooting.21:00: Play tennis with my father on the private tennis courts.23:00: Pack00:00: Bed time.Or, were I to be truthful…on my last full day at home in Miami: I woke up, worked out and made myself a nice breakfast, alcohol-free. I texted my girlfriend, who is 21, and not related to me. I read the Wall Street Journal and the cricket section of The Times to catch up on the test match. I got dressed and spent the morning engaging in retail therapy. I spent lunch with a couple of old school friends. I went sailing that afternoon, and went to mass in the evening. I played tennis at the island tennis courts down the road from my house, then packed a bag. The end.
