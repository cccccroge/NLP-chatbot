I'll write 2 answers to that:This was my routine some time back:7:00 am: Wake up - breakfast - getting ready8:00 am: Reach to school for teaching student12:30 pm: Have lunch - due to the running around there was no breakfast2:30 pm: Head out from school.3:00 pm: Report to Genetech Solutions - start with the review with project managers and take updates on tasks given the day before.7:00 pm: Take a short break and play Counter Strike (it's an open environment so no problem, apart from that, people are mostly signing off by then so there are a lot of people on the server)9:00 pm: Have dinner12:00 am: Head out to home again. This was working great but then I planned to get some entrepreneur stuff started so here is the new one:7:00 am: Report to Genetech Solutions - check emails and see for new customers9:00 am: As people start coming in keep taking daily updates - tell at the start of the day for the deadlines and the tasks of the day11:00 am: Go to the roof - have tea - chit chat with colleagues for 10-15 minutes02:00 pm: Lunch04:00 pm: Head out to home05:00 pm: Explore new things - learn a new language - check new businesses - visit old friends12:00 am: Head to bed.In between all the times in the office there is ofcourse work taken from other developers - checking with the QA team and writing back to customers - handling project messages too.So I like to keep it tight - its FUN!
