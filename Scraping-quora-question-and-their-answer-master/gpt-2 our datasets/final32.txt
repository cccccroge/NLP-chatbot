There really isn’t such a thing as a “typical day” in the ER, since it can vary enormously from one hour to the next.When you arrive at work, you punch in, get your room assignment, and then go get report on patients from the off-going nurse who had that room assignment before you. In my hospital, it’s expected that you will do bedside report, the idea being that the patient has a right to be involved in his/her own care plan. (Of course, if there are confidential concerns, these can be discussed out of the patient’s hearing.)Then you do a quick assessment on each patient, and check to see if there are any new orders on them. You also address concerns like pain, need for toilet assistance, questions, etc. In critical cases, I also check to see if there’s anything I can do for anxious family members (e.g., getting them coffee or answering general questions).If a patient is discharged, you print out their discharge paperwork (not forgetting any prescriptions and school/work excuse notes they might need) and go over it with them. You also check and record vitals, remove IVs, determine whether or not they need to be taken out in a wheel chair, etc.After the patient is discharged, you see to it that the room is cleaned and made up as quickly as possible, to accommodate the next patient.If a patient is admitted, you check to make sure a bed is assigned; then you call the nurse who will be caring for that patient and arrange a bedside report with him/her. You make sure all ER orders have been carried out; that IVs aren’t running dry; that you’ve collected all the patient’s belongings; that incontinent patients have been changed and cleaned up, etc., and then, after bedside report, you arrange to have the patient taken up to his/her assigned room.If you get a new patient (via ambulance or waiting room), you need to assess the patient and decide whether the unit’s standing orders should be implemented. For example, if a patient comes in complaining of severe abdominal pain, you will usually go ahead and start an IV, draw blood work, and get urine specimens before the doctor or provider ever enters the room. ER nurses have generous standing orders, because speed of care is an important quality measure of ER nursing.You take breaks when you can, IF you can. Breaks are seldom if ever assigned in my ER, because you never know what’s going to be happening at a given time. But, if there’s a lull and/or your patients don’t need anything, you give report to a coworker, and go eat lunch or just go sit for a while.At the end of your shift you give report to the oncoming nurse, check to see if you’re needed for anything else, and then punch out and go home.Sounds fairly straightforward, right? But that’s only how it works if nothing goes wrong, and, as Vincent Gardenia observed in the movie Moonstruck “something always goes wrong.” Here are some of the glitches that you need to be able to handle, in between these tasks:If a very critical patient arrives, you may need to drop what you’re doing and go help out immediately—-or at least to watch the floor while others leave their stable patients to go help stabilize the critical one.If you get an angry, belligerent or combative patient, you need to know how to defuse the situation——or, if you can’t, you may need to call security and consider restraints (physical or chemical). This requires getting a physician’s order and providing detailed documentation as to why other, less restrictive measures weren’t used.If a patient has symptoms that suggest isolation is indicated (e.g., profuse watery diarrhea, coughing up bloody sputum, symptoms of flu), you’re expected to initiate the appropriate isolation precautions. (You’re also expected to make sure that everyone, including physicians, follow those precautions unless they’re discontinued.)If a patient needs to use the rest room, it’s up to you to decide whether or not it’s safe to get him or her up. (Prevention of falls is a big issue in the ER.) This isn’t as easy as it sounds, because patients often balk at the idea of using a bed pan or commode. Yet, if they’re not steady on their feet, you’re taking a big risk in letting them get up on their own.The doctor or other provider sees the patient for only a few minutes, before giving initial orders. It’s up to you, the nurse, to detect and report signs and symptoms that might affect the preliminary diagnosis and care plan. For example, I once had an elderly patient from a nursing home who was (unusually for her) confused and sleepy. Knowing that sudden onset of confusion in an elderly person can often be a sign of a urinary tract infection, I went ahead and catheterized her (she was incontinent, so I couldn’t have her provide a specimen on her own). When I positioned her for catheterization, I noticed a number of bruises at the top of her inner right thigh, and reported them to the physician. He promptly ordered an Xray, and we found that she had a displaced hip fracture. Sounds weird that she wouldn’t have had other symptoms (deformity, moaning from pain), but she didn’t. Which is why the nurse needs to be quite meticulous at observation.ER patients, families and visitors are often tense and anxious, or even angry. You have to be able to defuse tense situations if necessary, such as, “My daughter has been waiting for an hour to be taken to her (inpatient) room. Why is she still sitting here?” “You’re not sticking a needle in my dad unless you promise me you can get it on the first try.” “But you don’t understand. My girlfriend can’t take any pain medication but Dilaudid. If you don’t give it to her, I’ll just take her someplace else where they will.” “But he’s hungry! Why can’t he have a turkey sandwich?” “My husband seems to have lost his cell phone. Can you help us find it?” “My daughter will have to come and get me and drive me home. My cell phone is dead and I can’t remember her number, but her name is Jane Smith. Can’t you look up her number in your records and call her?”Some patients require a lot of hands-on help: cleaning up incontinent behinds; reassuring terrified children who need an IV; supporting patients experiencing panic attacks or hallucinations; getting two large IVs into septic patients with terrible veins; patients with recent stroke symptoms who require a boatload of interventions IMMEDIATELY, etc. It’s up to you to juggle your many responsibilities, and know which ones are emergent, which are merely urgent; and which can wait for a bit. And to pacify those who end up having to wait a bit, because you must tend to a more critical or time-sensitive problem.
