Okay, so here’s the scoop of a typical day of a professional writer, or at least mine, anyway.I have regular office hours Monday through Friday from 5:00 AM to 4:00 PM. I have two offices in my home so I don’t go stir crazy being in one room all the time. I also spend my writing and researching hours at the library three days per week.Why eleven hours, you ask?I spend 5:30 AM to 7:30 AM answering emails from my readers. Acknowledging your readers is key to having readers.Then I take a 30 minute break to pack lunches and shuffle my family out the door. This time is what I refer to as chaos.I’m back at it by 8:00 AM and write consistently until 11:00 AM. I do not edit as I write. I don’t look back. I keep going. Just. Keep. Going. Sure they’ll be fuck ups, grammatically incorrect sentences and spelling errors but that’s what 2:00 to 3:00 PM is for. Also, I have a proofreader. My proofreader is bomb because after I’ve starred at the same thing for so long I can’t focus on it anymore.11:00 AM through 12:30 PM is, “My time.” During this time I power nap, exercise and/ or meditate. 70% because I can, 15% because I’m lazy and 15% because I don’t want to be fat and/ or die of heart disease.12:30 PM to 1:00 PM is spent attempting to interrupt my research notes because I insist on collecting these with pen and paper and my handwriting is so poor I can’t even read it.3: 00 PM to 4:00 PM is spent on social media marketing where I post these links everywhere I possible can and also respond to any comments.PatreonEtsyAmazonInstagramTwitterI also have a prepared FAQs to include all over the place as well.I read between the hours of 8:00 and 10:00 PM. This is kind of my unwinding and educational time. My husband, who I am crazy in love with goes to sleep at 8:00 PM every night and I’m just not ready for bed so it gives me a few extra hours.Fridays are spent entirely different. I spend Fridays pitching publications and sending out queries. By far the most stressful and boring work day of the week. I don’t read on Friday nights. I spike my coffee.I claim I take the weekends off but that’s basically a lie. I usually get up before my husband and I’ll get some work done until he wakes and is ready to read the newspaper together and make me breakfast. Being that I’m manic and he’s not I sleep less then he does. I also take notes everywhere we go. Writers are always on the hunt for good story ideas.When do I eat, you ask? All the time as most people with emotional eating issues do.
