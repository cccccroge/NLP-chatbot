My narcissist ex-husband had a very simple life, mostly because he trained me up to do his bidding. He basically had three things he took responsibility for. He worked and brought home the paycheck, mowed the lawn in summer and cleared the snow in the winter.Daily he woke, prepped himself and left for the office.I managed everything else.When they were babies, I saw to their every bed. I fed, nursed, clothed and bathed them. Laundry, housework and meals were squeezed in. No help from the husband/father figure ever.Husband in front of TV with beer and neespaper.Later, I would wake up at 6 AM, get the kids out of bed, fed and on the school bus. Start laundry, make beds, clean house, prep supper, get kids off the bus, get them a snack, start homework, supper on the table, clear up supper, kids to bed.Husband with newpaper, beer and television.I was mom AND dad. HE was constantly handing tasks to me. Take this to the township hall. I need you to drop this at the bank. Get to the hardware store for such and such. Call the repair guy for the this and that.The kids got through high school then college. I was beat up (emotionally and spiritually), worn out, tired of the disrespect, the anger and the hard-heartedness. I insisted on counseling for him. He said NO. I left him. It was the hardest thing I have ever done, yet I have had NO SINGLE MOMENT OF REGRET. I would do it all again.
