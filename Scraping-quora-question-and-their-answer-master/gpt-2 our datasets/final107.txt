After I get the kids off to school, I usually read the news about all of the dumb shit that conservatives have done over the past day or two.Typically, the news will follow some of the following themes:*There will be a shooting - that’s pretty much a given. On many days, it will take place in a school. Most of the time, it’s a white male that owns a small arsenal, taking out his troubles on somebody else. Sometimes, it’s a toddler who has found one of the family guns. This happens about once a week. (American toddlers are still shooting people on a weekly basis this year .) It is never followed up by any congressional action on gun control.*Our president will have done something new to embarrass those of us who care what the rest of the world thinks. This week, he’s getting sued by a porn star because when he paid her hush money before the election, he was too stupid to sign the agreement. Last week, he ordered a bunch of tee markers bearing the presidential seal for his golf courses. Next week, who knows?*Somebody on Trump’s staff will have quit/been fired/been indicted.*The president will exchange hostile tweets with somebody, and lose the battle.*Science, logic, and reason will suffer another setback.*Once every month or so, Betsy DeVos will come out of hiding and visit a school; she will then be booed by a hostile audience and go back into hiding for a month.*White supremacists will somehow push their agenda forward.Then I spend the rest of the day wondering how so many people, with public education available to all, can be so friggin’ stupid as to elect - and even continue to support - an obvious liar and con man.Then, I go to bed, and hope tomorrow is somehow better.It’s a lot like Groundhog Day.EDITED 10 DAYS LATER:So a little more than a week has passed, and most of my predictions have come true.It’s been a quiet week for mass shootings. Yay!President Trump embarrassed us this week by a) making up statistics when talking with PM Trudeau, and b) firing McCabe one day before he was eligible to retire, then calling it a “great day for democracy.”Tillerson, McMaster, and McCabe were all fired. Tillerson found out about it on Twitter. He was the Secretary of State.The Environmental Protection Agency is trying to repeal the Clean Power Act. EPA's proposed repeal will make Americans sickerBetsy DeVos appeared on Sixty Minutes, and removed any lingering doubts there might have been about her staggering incompetence.A resolution denouncing neo-Nazis and white supremacists was killed in short order in Tennessee. A resolution denouncing neo-Nazis dies in 36 secondsI’m sure I missed a few things.
