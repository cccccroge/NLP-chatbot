In May of last year I did an exercise where I logged every single thing I did for a week. It's kind of boring, but it gives you a good idea what a typical week looks like while running a startup, in chronological order.I ended up posting it in a blog on one of my websites so the other members could get an idea what my days normally look like. It's not like the movies, but it actually helps me out to look back at it every once in awhile.Take a glance if you're bored:http://fubar.com/living-the-drea...-mike
