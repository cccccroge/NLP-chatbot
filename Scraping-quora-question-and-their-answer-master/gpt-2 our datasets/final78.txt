Well... usually routines start in the AM and it usually goes like7:00 AM - Wake Up7:30 AM - BreakfastblahblahBut for an average BITSian, the beginnings of a day are not as clearly defined as the ending. A typical BITSian (2nd/3rd yearite) sleeps at 3-4 AM after going to the Night Canteen and spending some good time with friends on the bench in the cool breeze at 2 AM. What precedes the trip to the NC is either a DOTA or a CS match (CoD is catching up these days!!) (again with friends, but maybe a different group) or finishing a season of Suits or Boston Legal or GoT (given the recent hype) or <insert any good, decently popular show here>, some people watch Jon Stewart or catch up on a few episodes on New Releases. This activity typically starts at around 6 PM. Another set of people play TT from 7 to 8 as a pre-dinner exercise. The common room will be full if there is a match on.I don't know about the other campuses, but it seems likely that a healthy percentage of BITSians are into exercise or maybe the awesome evening weather of Goa is an excuse for people to get out of their rooms. Lots of people jog or go play badminton, football, Frisbee or cricket. (5:00 to 7:00). Dinner follows.Now the fun part. 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Class hours. This depends a lot on the courses of a typical BITSian. Attendance may be mandatory or ideal for some classes. Some of them are a bore. Some have surprise tests. So a typical BITSian may attend around 50% of the classes (this number varies widely depending on the factors mentioned above and more). Tutorials are early in the morning for most courses (8:00 AM). A relatively higher percentage of people attend tutorials because they are more hands on and cover matter which may be important from an examination point of view. Most of the students (who go to the tutorial) go back to sleep after they come back from the tutorial. Some students just get up at 1:00 PM and have lunch, come back and chill.The routine (if we are still calling it that) described above varies widely. Believe it or not, the above may account for a maximum of 35-40% of the student population). There are several groups of people, each with their unique routine. The gamers, the recreational users, the exercise nuts, the 10ps, the OCD guys, the really smart guys who don't care about cg, I could go on... The average BITSian is lost amongst these classifications and is, in a sense, another group.Although nearly all of them become one huge mass 3 days before and 1 day after T1/T2/Compre. This is when the average BITSian shines. Nightouts are common. The library is full. The powers of concentration are multiplied as though influenced by some rare celestial occurrence. The nerds and padhakus are momentary heroes and DC mainchat is full of "please lend ... book for one day" and "share notes of ...". And after the exam, they still remain the huge mass... only the party continues at Bogmalo!
