I am an ICU nurse. I generally look after either 1 patient, or I will work in a support role, looking after up to 5 nurses, who have 1 patient each. We generally work 12 1/2 hr shifts, day and night.We have 1 nurse:1 patient or if a patient is needing lots of help we will have 2 nurses:1 patient. 2:1 as an allocation is rare, but during the day the bedside nurse will often need an extra pair of hands, so that support person helps.My day generally depends how sick the patient is. As you'll see, it's hard to break down into time blocks. We have three types of days:- 1)  The kind of day where you aim to achieve 1 new thing towards getting the patient out of ICU or hospital. 1 thing in 12hrs doesn't sound like much, but it's surprising what can happen to sidetrack you from your goal.2)  The second kind of day is one where you work one thing after another to keep a very sick patient going. Think one of those dramatic scenes in ER, in slow motion. Adding infusions, administering blood, giving medications and taking trips to Radiology, Cath lab or theatre. 3)  The last kind of day is the day where there is nothing spectacular left to do for the patient except for comfort cares - the heart of all nursing care. We spend a lot of time with family and friends of the patient on those days.Regardless, every day has some challenges. Our patients have lots of drips: 14 is my record. That's one pump for each, with associated alarms and flashing lights. Many of the drugs are dangerous and unsafe for use outside the ICU. Sometimes the patients are so sick that pausing the pump to swap to a new bag can cause them to become sicker. We use bigger bags with more drug in them to minimise this if the patient is that sick, but that can mean drawing up to 30 little ampuoles at a time and each of them has to be checked by two RN's, so that takes time. Lots of drugs interact in the plastic tubing and can precipitate into solids, this can block the drip and make it unusable.We also have the patients usual medications, and antibiotics and things.So we have to know a lot about pharmacology to make sense of all that.I work in an ICU that takes everything (some units specialise: cardiac or neurology or surgical for example). We have to know all about the broad range of trauma, surgery and diseases we meet on a daily basis, so that means being up to date on physiology and pathophysiology.As you can imagine, our assessment skills have to be pretty good! We monitor ECG (for the heart rate and rhythm); blood pressure (continuously via a special line); oxygen in the blood through a probe on the patients finger and through special blood tests; temperature; breath volumes, rates and pressures; chest sounds and daily chest X-rays; pulses everywhere; pupil sizes and shapes; level of consciousness and pain experienced by the patient; and all fluids going into the patient and coming back out. We also look at skin integrity and dressings or drains. We add things to that list depending on why the patient is in ICU.We record this hourly but keep an eye on it all constantly. And we keep up with our patient's hygiene needs (sponging, washing hair, brushing teeth and moisturising eyes etc).We have some big dressings: changing the dressings alone can sometimes take an hour or more. Some of the more run of the mill dressings can involve changing the dressings in a patients' open wound: like in theatre, but without the sewn up bit. (The patient is usually sedated and on lots of pain relief).All this whilst educating and reassuring families and friends! (We are also part social worker!)We have a lot of autonomy compared to other wards. As a training hospital, most of the nurses are more prepared than the junior doctors in training. We have a drawer near the patient's bed with some of the first line emergency drugs in it, and we can give some of those drugs before we call the doctors for help. We also take blood for testing from arteries (mostly through a special monitoring line but also with needles) and send off and monitor the kind of blood tests you get when you go to see your doctor for a check up. We do these ones daily, and we top up electrolytes depending on what we find.And then we get to the machinery...ventilators (for breathing) - nearly everyone is on one of those; dialysis machines (for kidney support) - common, but not everyone; pacemakers and balloon pumps (for sick hearts) - pacemakers are common, balloon pumps less so; ECMO machines (for really sick patients) - rare, thankfully and more - they're all the ICU nurse's responsibility.A busy day might also involve going to theatre and starting dialysis on a patient having an emergency operation, or using one of our ventilators (more sensitive for very sick patients) or helping to replace blood quickly.Our ICU also offers a service where we go onto the ward and support the ward nurses with tricky problems and emergencies.We are all RN's, and most of us have a second (and sometimes third) post graduate qualification to help educate us for the role.So I think you can see it's a busy day. That list of types of day I mentioned earlier? Sometimes that's just the one day, with just the one patient...
