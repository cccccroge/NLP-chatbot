Wow, I am under-qualified to answer this question but I'll give you an idea which I have from a buddy who is studying his PhD with hopes to be a bio-medical physicist. Most of his time is spent in the lab. I'm saying, every single time we are going out for drinks or Chili's my buddy is being picked up from his lab and then being dropped off right back there. So I assume with experimental physics you're going to get very cozy with the various research facilities on campus, and during crunch time, you're going to be there as much as you can possibly be. I know that he is also TA's two courses a week and probably spends a total of 10 hours prepping for those courses, grading and doing tutoring sessions. Overall you're going to see a huge difference in the day to day of physicists depending on their speciality: bio-medical, theoretical, geological, etc.
