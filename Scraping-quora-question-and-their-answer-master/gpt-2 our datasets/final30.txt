I would think that this question must have been asked by someone who is not in the medical profession. What many people do not understand is that there are many specialties in Nursing. Nursing is a profession. It is made up of professional people who chose to be nurses. It is not made up of people who weren't smart enough to be doctors. As a matter of fact, there are nurses who have earned the title of PhD so they should be addressed as Dr. (Last Name)...Please do not read this as a rant. It is not. I have been a nurse for 33 years. I fully understand that people who are not in healthcare do not understand how specialized all fields of healthcare have become. I do not understand the specializations of other professions, either. (Following are just a few brief examples of a sampling of what nurses do. There are a number of other nurse specialties. Some are addressed in the answers other people have already written.)In a typical workday, depending on a nurse's specialty, An office nurse might triage phone calls that bring patient in for evaluation. Office nurses are also the front line to evaluating patients in the office. After a physician sees a patient, it is usually the nurse who explains the discharge instructions.In a labor and delivery unit, the nurse might work for 12 to 16 hours with a variety of patients (In states without labor unions, it is not uncommon to "pull a double.") She is on the front line and evaluates both the health of the mother and the baby. Through her observations, the physician is kept informed when they are not able to be at the bedside continuously. Yes, on occasion, it has to be the nurse who does the delivery and deals with the patient and baby until the doctor arrives. This is not a bad reflection on anyone. Babies come when babies come and arrive in the back seat of the car, in the hallway, in the elevator, in the doctor's office waiting room and sometimes rapidly in the labor and delivery unit.In an ICU, a nurse monitors the many machines used to evaluate the physical condition of a patient, evaluates lab results to determine which ones warrant an immediate call to the doctor and which ones can wait until the doctor makes rounds, monitors the many machines used to delivery medications and other functions. One patient may be on 6 different IV drips, have cardiac monitors, have pulse oximeters, invasive blood pressure monitors, be on a ventilator, have chest tubes, urinary catheters, wound vacs, various dressings...The nurse also interacts often with the families of those same patients.In an ER, the nurse might be called upon to deal with any emergence for any condition. They see massive trauma, cardiac emergencies, allergic reactions, obstetrical emergencies (Remember, babies don't care where they are when they come out.) The ER nurse will also have to coordinate (triage) which patient is seen in which order. In most cases the most critical get the most attention. In mass emergencies where a multitude of patients arrive at the same time, the focus might have to change to separating the ones with the least chance of survival and concentrating on the ones with the best chance. Harsh reality but you can only do so much and if the whole ER staff is focused on one massively injured patient while 50 others are coming in, then fewer people will survive.A "floor nurse" has to organize a workload in order to get all treatments and medications delivered in a timely manner, review and revise the plan of care for each patient, interact with the physician and the family members and attend to comfort needs of the patients.An informatics nurse brings clinical knowledge to a new field of medicine, Informatics. In today's computer age, nurses and physicians must document care via computers. The clinical knowledge that nurses bring assists them in being able to program user interfaces in such a way that medical professionals can record their findings in a quick efficient manner.As you can see, this question cannot be answered with a simple list.
