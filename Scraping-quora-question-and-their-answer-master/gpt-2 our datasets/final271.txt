Honestly.. Usually my dreams are much more peaceful and exiting than my “waking life”I has changed my life because all I want to do is sleep. I go off to a better.. More sane worldsI am not slave in my dreams (like I am here to the “taxman”).. I wake up dissapointed I'm back here.. And not there still…It has also made me really question if any of this is “real”… as i have remembered this life in my dream.. And thought of this life in my dream.. As i do my dreams in this life..
