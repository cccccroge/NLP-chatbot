Really depends on the day.Usually, I have to defend my views all day long, especially when I am at the university. I have occassional conservations with fellow students about intersectional feminism, immigration and socialism.I noticed that they do not care. They visit lectures about “anti-nationalism”, and suddenly, everyone is an anti-nationalist. They visit lectures about diverse leadership, and suddenly, they can’t see qualities: only diversity. It’s not so bad at my own studies, but damn, there are some studies out there, where it’s basically a shame to be a straight, white man.I am wondering all day long how universities have become bubbles of left-wing views. There is no sharing of information anymore - just accepting and moving on. Luckily, I found various right-wing students who agree with me. That might be a good strategy for all of you: “just find someone who agrees with you”. Just know that you are not alone. There are a lot of students out there who don’t know what other ideologies there are. They think it’s racist to love your own culture. I have been asked “why a nationalist would do an international program”. Laughing is all I can.Just do not go with the flow - but research your own questions. I don’t care if you’re a social liberal, a social democrat, a national syndicalist or a classical liberal. Just make sure that you can have a decent conservation and defend your views. If you have to call me racist - then you do not belong at the university.That’s why I am wondering all day long.
