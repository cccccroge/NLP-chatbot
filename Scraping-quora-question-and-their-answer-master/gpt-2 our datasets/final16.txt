Most of them lead a very hectic and tough life. As the DM or Collector, they are on duty 24x7. Any event anywhere within their area of jurisdiction, they have to be there immediately to tackle it. Any problem anywhere, they are responsible!The IAS officers sitting in ministries , whether centre or state, are responsible for policy making, answering to innumerable queries, solving never ending problems. They work till late at night on a regular basis.Beyond that, most of them are genuine human beings who go beyond their charter of duties, to help the average people..The problem with our country is that we areÂ  too influenced by bollywood movies, and mostly hear about the "bad" and corrupt officers. In no way I am trying to say that all IAS officers are messengers of God! Its just that there's a fair mixture of good and bad in IAS, same as is the case everywhere in our society.
