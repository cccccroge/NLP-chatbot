I’m not sure there is a real answer to this question. Your daily experience will vary massively depending on your age, education, gender, interests, and your level of income/wealth. Compared to other places, I’d say that a typical SV day is defined by opportunity:You will have the opportunity to have an interesting conversation with a stranger who is very expert in something.You will have the opportunity to eat something good and drink something interesting.You will have the opportunity to see something beautiful in nature (I get to see the Bay and foothills every day, and I feel lucky every time).You will have the opportunity to see some art. Or craft, something at which our “maker culture” really excels.You will have the opportunity to make some money.You will have the opportunity to spend way too much money, on everything from pourover coffee to private school tuition.You will have the opportunity to walk pretty much the entire length of El Camino Real from South SF to San Jose without being threatened, either by the crooks or by the cops. This, to me, is a *massive* contrast from other American metro areas.Thanks for the A2A.
