I used to work for Social Security Disability (neither a liberal nor a conservative organization) and would read “Activities of Daily Living” (ADLs) on a regular basis, which I found comforting because people don’t differ all that much in their routines. After writing this, I realize I am a walking, talking liberal cliche.ADLS: Wake up around 5 or 5:30. Most of the time my husband feeds the animals (4 dogs, 1 cat) but sometimes I’ll feed at least the cat. They are all rescues, because as a liberal I feel deeply for all earth’s creatures. I take two meds that involve waiting another 30 minutes before I eat, make some coffee, and sit in front of the light box while reading on the computer. The light box is for depression, because as a liberal living in Trumpland, well … then I read the New York Times, not because it’s a liberal cliche - which I fully admit it is - but mainly out of habit. I grew up reading the Washington Post, and don’t know why I switched to NYT (have never lived in NY).Make some breakfast. I eat mostly low-fat vegan, so usually have a dry bagel and fruit or some oatmeal. I’m not mostly vegan because I’m a liberal, though, but to keep from developing various metabolically horrifying diseases that cost a lot in medical treatment. Because I know the Republicans are working hard to take away any chance I have of Medicare.After breakfast, do a few minutes exercise on the mini-tramp to get the blood flowing. Then I do Lumosity for 10 or 15 minutes (brain training software), then take whatever other vitamins I need (fish oil, B, and D), then get to work.I work at home, part-time, about 5 hours a day, and I usually start between 7:30 and 8. I sit down and check my weekly to do list, and add any items that have come up since the day before. Then check email and my calendar to make sure I don’t have meetings (which I rarely do, thankfully). If it’s Thursday I go into the office, have an 8–10 meeting then spend the morning there.I spend the day reviewing and reading grants and papers, writing sections of same, researching grant possibilities, and taking care of leftover work on a research project that is about 2/3 complete, which includes survey development, IRB, etc. Naturally, I work in tobacco control - part of the liberal conspiracy to get people to quit smoking. Also part of my liberal agenda - I work for a public university where I’ve earned - you guessed it - a couple of degrees.I take a break around 9:30 or 10 and walk around or use the mini-tramp for exercise for 10 minutes, because sitting is the new smoking.Check email, rinse and repeat with work stuff, check items off my list, add new items. If I’m at home I’ll take another break before lunch, go across the street to the communal (socialist, obviously) pool and sit in the jacuzzi, then shower there because I live in Arizona and the outdoor shower is very pleasant. In summer, I would do all this very early in the morning.I make lunch (usually veggies and noodles or rice), then eat while working, typically.I stop working around 2, usually taking another exercise break. Depending on the heat index, I might walk the dogs. If summer, might swim a few laps in the pool.Sometimes I get distracted and waste time on Quora (like today).In the afternoon, I do weight exercises for 15 minutes. I read, run errands, or do chores. If my husband gets home early, we might drive across the street and play 18 holes of disc golf (a sport that zero conservatives even know exists).In the evening, I watch TV (John Oliver, Bill Maher) for a half hour or hour, or play backgammon with the husband, or occasionally go to a friend’s house and play board games. One night a week I get a massage. After about 7 or 8, I will usually read or play Scrabble or send an email.Now and again I go to the occasional lecture at the university on a weeknight. This week we are seeing the Cirque du Soleil and going to a wedding.Weekends are for golf, short trips, house projects, dog walks, bicycle riding, writing, dinner with friends, etc. I am perfectly happy with this lifestyle and have reached an age where I’m very fortunate to be able to work part-time.
