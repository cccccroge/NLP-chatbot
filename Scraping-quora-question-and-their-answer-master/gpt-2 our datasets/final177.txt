Wake up to the National anthem;Open all the windows and turn the a/c on at maximum power (I do the same in winter with the heating);Call the manager of my South Asian manufacturing plant to make sure:- they’re meeting the production quota;- all the children are working there;- they’ve been working non stop for the past 18 hours;- there’s still no manufacturing security;Have an abused animal killed in front of my eyes in the most excruciating way by my undocumented, foreign servant and have it for breakfast;Go out in the garden of my mansion, turn on my Hummer and start to rev up the engine;Move to my rotary cannon location and start shooting at targets shaped as immigrants, social justice warriors, liberals and millennials;Go back inside while the power is still on and move funds to my several offshore accounts;Quick search on the Internet for the establishment that pays its workers the least amount of money and go have lunch there;Lunch, no tipping;After lunch I and my conservative friends dress up as cowboys and go around town on diesel pickups shooting at solar panels and slashing hybrid and electric cars tyres;While we are around town we give counterfeit money as alms to panhandlers, then call the police and report them;Back home, when the stock exchange has closed, I check how much money I have made speculating;Depending on the profit I’ve made I decide how much money to give to conservative politicians and think-tanks;I spend some time relaxing on the Internet and “like” all of Tomi Lahren’s posts and try to hit on her on social media. I also look for elaborate dishes and then I proceed to order my undocumented and underpaid staff to prepare those dishes, or else I’ll report all of them to the police;I start running the water for the shower I’ll take in a couple of hours;I have dinner with my staff watching me;I doze off on my couch - made from several kinds of endangered species leather - watching Fox News;I salute the portraits of George W. Bush and Bill O’Reilly and go to bed;
