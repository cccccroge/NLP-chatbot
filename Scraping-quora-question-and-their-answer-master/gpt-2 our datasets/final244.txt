You are a shell of a person. Compliant, obedient and a servant. Forever alone.While in the relationship I thought it was perfect. It was only out of it that I realised how much of myself I had lost to become what he wanted me to be. Compliant.Things were fine as long as things were his way. If at any time I challenged him, he would verbally squish me down until I felt worthless. How dare I speak my mind! Only he is right. Have to be obedient.You don’t know how to behave at times. There’s conflict inside. The part of you who was assertive and strong keeps knocking at the back of your mind, but you ignore it. You are not important. He is. You only exist to serve him.If I say the wrong thing he’ll get upset. So I’ll stay away and give him space. But he is still upset. What did I forget? I didn’t stroke his ego today. The silent treatment begins. With company, I’m alone once again.A typical day with a narcissist is a rollercoaster of emotions that you have to lock away inside of yourself and forget. The daily process of becoming the shell he wants you to be.
