It varies from person to person and also which year you are in.Â  I was not a gamer or a geek so my routine may be slightly different. I am concentrating on aspects other than studies.I am from 2004 batch of Goa, in the first year we dint have many facilities but still it was the best year. In those days TT tables and carrom boards used to be in mess, there were days on which we used to go to mess for breakfast and return back to hostel after lunch. People used to take turns to play carroms, if someone had a class in between for an hour and they wanted to attend they left the game and someone else joined. In the evenings after snack we played volley ball on the road between the Boys mess and central lawn. This was in the first sem, I remember that day when the whole campus was studying for thermodynamic exam as it was the first exam and we played volley ball. Our compre preparation were accompanied by a videocon walkman playing songs from Swades and veerzaara, we dint have computers in first year. In the whole hostel there were hardly 5 computers. Karteek Ch can add more on this. In the second sem, few student activities had started and for people who were involved in them evenings were mostly spent in some meetings. By second year you would have made your core set of friends and your routine revolves around what are your common interests. Our sundays and holidays were mostly spent relaxing on the BH1 hostel pathway. After screwing two years my third year was mostly spent on Eco CDC's as I was a dualite. Evenings were spent in Quark, waves and Elections planning. Fourth year was full of parties, being a dualite we had the luxury of taking placement parties from both the batches of single degree students. We had parties almost twice a week and the rest of the time we played cards. All in all it was very different from what is the routine of current students, I visited campus in 2011 and was shocked to see all the hostel rooms locked during class hours. I had never seen such a silent hostel in all my campus life.There are many other things like common room gatherings and cricket in lawn that I havent mentioned above.
