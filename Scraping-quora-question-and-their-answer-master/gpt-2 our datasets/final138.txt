I don't think we can call my parents elderly just yet. My mum is turning 59 this May and my dad is turning 60 this June. My mum retired early at age 55, my dad retired from his job of 20 years around the same time and now running his own company. They both have decent amount in their bank account so for the last 5 years, they have been traveling around a lot. My dad like to travel to places that don't have much tourists and explore the wilderness and culture so he usually join some group of younger people that plan their own trip and not going through any tour company. My mum sometimes get to tag along but her health doesn't allow her to follow him everywhere. She cannot handle extreme conditions so she only joins in trips that go around cities without too much walking. The rest of the time, she goes on tour with her friends. Just over a year ago, she started to have problem with her spine so she has been traveling less and spend most of her time going to the hospital for treatment and therapy. She also comes to New Zealand a few times a year to visit me and my son for the last 3 years.On days that they spend at home, my mum usually wakes up around 6.30am and do her back exercise. She then goes to the market to buy groceries and has breakfast. After dropping off groceries at home, she gets ready to go to her appointment at the hospital or go to the gym for yoga and excercise. On a Wednesday, she will call my son and I while doing her exercise because that's one of the only 2 days that we are home. After gym, she takes a bath there (save water at home haha) and walks home for lunch. I have no idea what she does in the afternoon, probably has a nap and does more exercise, watch TV, meet up with friends, whatever comes up in her schedule. Around 5, she starts cooking dinner for my dad and my brother. Sometimes my dad goes out for a drink and invites her to come then they will eat out afterwards. In the evening, they're most likely just watch TV by themselves in their own rooms.My dad usually wakes up at 7.30am, water the plants and do the laundry before getting ready to leave for work. He leaves home around 8 or 8.30, have breakfast out then off to work. His job is mostly just signing paperworks, making sure there is no mistakes in the paperworks, talk to his connection to get the job done easier and overseeing project. He wants to retire for good soon so he tries to train his employees as much as possible for the job so he can leave. He usually has lunch at work but would let my mum know if he's coming home for lunch and for a nap. After work, he likes to go have a drink or two before coming home for dinner. He spends his evening watching TV.So that's their typical days but since the amount of days in a year they travel around are usually more than the amount of time they're home so I'm not sure what is their “typical” anymore.
