It just depends where you are in the three stages. If you are in the idealize stage then everyday is amazing with the Narcissist. If you are in the devalue stage then you have been introduced to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Once you reach this stage your days will be completely unpredictable. You could be out at a restaurant having a great time. Ten minutes later he is screaming and getting in your face over the dumbest thing. This becomes an every day occurrence. If you are in the discard stage then you are seeing his demonic self come out. Once he has a new woman in his life he will up the crazy behavior. Now, he feels powerful when he is calling you names. He loves it that he can be himself with you because he has to be fake with her. I remember the last Narc would be itching to call me names. It was like he couldnâ€™t wait to get his drama fix with me. I could not believe it. It was like a demon came out of him. I felt so stupid for being conned so well for so long.
