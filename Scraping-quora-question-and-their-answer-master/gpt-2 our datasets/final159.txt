My parents have both died, but I can tell you about the trajectory of my mother’s elder days. When she was in her 70’s, my mother lived with my sister. She would wash dishes, fold laundry, go to religious services and read. Lots of reading. She could still take a plane ride to see me. In her 80’s, my mother began showing signs of Parkinson’s and Alzheimers. She shuffled as she walked, and did not want to take walks outside anymore, even on a sunny day. She became more and more dependent on my sister for health care: doctor visits, medications (about a dozen), and general well being. In her late 80’s, my mother began to fall at home. When all my sister’s efforts to prevent falls proved ineffective, my mother checked into a facility for Jewish elderly. She was assigned a room where she would stay the rest of her life. When my sister would visit, they would go outside to the patio and sit in the sun and talk. My mother continued to read and learn, and go to religious services. At 94, she fell for the last time. She hit her head, had about 24 hours of lucidity, then entered a coma and died four days later.
