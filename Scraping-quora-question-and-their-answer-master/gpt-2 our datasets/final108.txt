I can’t answer for anyone else, but a typical day for me involves nonstop attacks on everything that conservatives hold dear.I start the morning by waking up in Canada, where I’ve moved from the United States because Canada has better healthcare, greater freedom, and a higher standard of living.I begin my morning by drinking tea, not the coffee that we all know conservatives prefer.While I drink my tea, I faff about on Quora, spreading the Liberal Agenda™ and leading to questions about why Quora is so liberal.[1][2][3][4][5]I then go to work. I work from home, like a true liberal does, not from a gigantic corporate office like a good conservative. I’m a writer by trade, meaning I must be part of the liberal media. Today, for example, I worked on the last round of changes to the novel Black Iron, which is social satire about xenophobia and racism disguised as alternate-history comedy.I talk to one or more of my girlfriends, with whom I’m in a liberal polyamorous relationship, rather than a nice conservative monogamous heterosexual couple.I work on my liberal hobbies, which generally involve violating conservative social and sexual mores. For example, one of my hobbies involves using a 3D printer to create molds for custom-designed sex toys, which as all good conservatives know are an abomination before all that is holy.After that, I help make liberal supper, or on very liberal days I make supper myself, rather than let her do it (as we all know that such things are women’s work). It’s just my liberal way of smashing the patriarchy.Afterward, Eve and I will often engage in liberal recreation, such as watching liberal shows like Sense8 on Netflix or going to liberal movies like Black Panther.Footnotes[1] Is all of Quora liberal?[2] Is it just me, or are the answerers of Quora overwhelmingly liberal?[3] Why is Quora so overwhelmingly liberal and hostile?[4] Why is Quora allowing a liberal agenda?[5] Why is Quora so pointedly liberal?
