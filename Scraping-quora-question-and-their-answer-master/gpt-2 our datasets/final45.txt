I wake up every day (except Sunday) at 7:30am, go through my morning routine, which usually takes about an hour and includes praying, meditating, eating breakfast, re-checking the schedule and adding things that need to be done in my Google Calendar. I might workout as well if I feel like I want to. Then I head to uni, or if I don’t have lectures, to the library. Your house might be peaceful for studying but I feel like my house is the place where I’m supposed to relax after a long day, so I can’t really concentrate on work in my place. My individual studying routine lasts for about 6–8 hours every day (including Sunday). It is very important that you stay focused during that time. Make sure you are not distracted by social media and if needed, block your social media!To be honest, I’m not that good in learning from the textbooks, so I often use Lecturio videos and make notes from there. So that then, I can see what do I need to add from the textbook. I get things done much quickly with this method and I highly recommend it to everyone else. It’s worse paying for subscriptions of teaching platforms, because they really make a huge difference in your academic performance.At night, my brain just shuts down… Some of my friends say it’s really bad, cause I need to push myself to the fullest but to be honest, chill tie is also very important + I’m very happy that my physiologic clock is not f**ked up (yet). So I finish my library time at about 9pm, head back home, and sleep at about 11–12pm
