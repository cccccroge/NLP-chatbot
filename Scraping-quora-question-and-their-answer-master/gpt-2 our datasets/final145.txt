I am a caregiver to elderly folks.They watch a LOT of TV. Theyre often quite bored. They may play games on a smartphone (if they know how to use it). They work on paying their bills and organizing their little areas, and plan sending those cards and small birthday gift checks at great length. They organize birthdates and call customer service numbers a LOT with piddly complaints. Lol (truth)They look through the advertising circulars for deals and coupons.. they flip through their shopping catalogues.They reminisce about their families a LOT..They focus on their prescriptions and taking everything on time.They snack, a great deal.They cook sometimes. They love to cook, and are proud of their dishes.They go for walks, mostly to get outside for a few minutes, and also because they get very lonely.They adore animals, and love visiting with their own dogs and cats or their neighbors pets.They love having visitors. They enjoy adult day care and any other social interaction.Some are pretty funny about saving stuff. I had one gal that got disposable pads that she laid on, at night, in bed. She would try so hard to reuse them, but they slid off the bed every day. She focused on trying to find ways to make that one pad last for a week, to avoid filling landfills. I only saw her a couple of times a week, so I just changed the darn thing, and put a stack by her bed, so she could just throw the old ones outâ€¦ But she never wanted to. They were clean!! She recycled religiously also.Older people also gossip a lot. If you ever feel like an elderly person is being overly critical, just leave it alone. Tell them you appreciate their advice and will try to do better and LEAVE IT. lolThey are SO bored. So bored. Omg.If there are any hobbies and activities that you can set up for them in their home, and even a weekly bingo hall trip, it would be A-OK!!Solitude SUCKS. Royally. Its the worst part about old age, imho.The lucky ones still have family that they live with that care. Or family that calls every day. Even adult day care.. its fantastic.Try to help her to avoid long stretches of solitude.. The happy ones have the most social interaction. That I can promise you. xo
