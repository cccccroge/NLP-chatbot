When I wake up, I spin my abuse wheel on who I’m going to torture today. I take a shower with the tears of the empaths I keep locked up in my basement. They’re hooked up to this contraption where I telepathically send them visions of their families that they haven’t seen in years. This makes them cry, and I have a pipe system linked up to my shower head. I then use a gaslighting face cream. It alters reality so my face looks absolutely spectacular.You know the spray Annabeth gives Tyson in Sea of Monsters? It kinda works like that. It hides my devil horns and scars, so I can blend in with humanity. By this, I mean the movie and I hate the movie with a passion. I wouldn’t even link this if there was a better way to explaining it.I brush my teeth with more empath tears. I also have to put on brown contacts to hide my mangekyo sharingan.I head to university, carve a pentagram into the lecture hall, summon Satan with the blood of a virgin and get more narcissist powers. After that, I go to work for a few hours, and then go home.Aiden Léger's answer to How does a narcissist's daily life look like?Well, I don’t know about my “daily life” but I have short entries about how I perceive particular events on my blog Life Experiences.Contrary to popular belief, I don’t spend my day plotting to overthrow or gaslight people. That gives narcissists a level of awareness that we don’t possess. Most narcissists go through life completely unaware of the effect they have on people. It’s something like “Why does this always happen to me?” The issue is that we can’t understand that the common denominator of all our situations is us, and we might be contributing to why everything always ends up badly. If that’s the case, how can we plan stuff out? How can I possibly go out of my way to conduct smear campaigns and gaslight without any idea that I’m doing so? With my level of awareness, I can see particular behaviours that are unhealthy, and I’m working on those, but other than that, I have next to no idea what I’m doing.My typical day is the exact same as anyone else’s. There is nothing that separates my day from anyone else’s besides our individuality. The only difference is that you’re expecting it to be much different because you believe that I want to be abusive and destroy people. The truth is that I don’t really know what I’m doing or why I’m doing it. To be honest with you all, I’m completely winging adulthood. I’m not even sure how this entire thing works or how I’m supposed to be an adult and form proper relationships. I only formed my first real friendship a few days ago.
