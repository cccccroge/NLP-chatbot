My mother is 92 years old. Although she has some memory issues, she keeps active during the day, a true adherent to the pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps mentality. She has never cut any of us any slack, and she cuts none for herself. Her own mother in her 80s, approached by a boy scout for her help in his earning of a badge sputtered “I told him ‘No!’” I'm not anybody's g.d. project!!”She sets her alarm for 5 a.m. She used to work a swing shift as a radio dispatcher. Her 70-year-old son asks her why she still gets up at this time. She says that she feels ‘morally' better if she gets up early. This is the same reason she gives for tea totalling.When she rises, she checks Google to see what day it is, lets out and feeds her two dogs, gets a glass of juice, and sits down in front of FOX News with her knitting. She might write herself a note as to the date, if the dogs have been fed, or what knitting pattern she'll look up on the internet later in the day. She begins to worry about what to make for dinner and may get some meat out of the freezer to thaw. In the morning, she occupies herself with various chores, doing dishes or laundry. She eats lunch at 11 a.m., a measured one-half cup of cottage cheese laced with fruit and cinnamon. She takes no medications, and, who knows, maybe it's the cinnamon that keeps her ticking. She eats in front of FOX News, sometimes falling asleep with the spoon in her hand. She speaks sharply to the cat if she tries to usurp her space, and the dogs may or may not be invited to share her chair. After lunch she takes a two-hour nap. (FOX News continues to drone in the background.) When the phone rings, she hangs up alike on scammers, pollsters, and the Order of Police asking for money for teddy bear donations.After her nap, she goes out to the kitchen to begin making dinner for her and my brother. If I am home at this time, I am regaled by her observations about why the female FOX presenters must dress like prostitutes, her memories of school, her complaints about the grass (which she mowed herself until she was 89), and her thoughts on the political climate. Her critique of my hair, my clothing, my habits, and my dog have ceased since her vision has become more impaired. She, however, refuses to have her eyes examined.After enjoying dinner, she goes out to the kitchen to wash the dinner dishes, although I will have beaten her to it, so she is soon free to sit and watch more FOX, often missing the report because she is not done yet commenting on the physical appearance of the presenters, male and female alike. Next, she pours herself a small glass of Coke--"something cold"--and writes her elderly brother an email. Dressing for bed is next. She will fall asleep in her chair for an hour or two before going off to bed.I live with her, would like to spoil her, but she will rarely have it. After she took a plunge into the phone table, I bought her a four-footed cane with neon butterflies up the staff. More often than not, she *carries* the cane carefully from room to room. On occasion, I have seen her carrying her dishes back to the kitchen in one hand and her cane in the other, toddling at a fast trot because of her two-handed burden. When I reprimand her, she waves me away. I regularly get to hear her plans for her next life when she reincarnates--she will not marry and be a business woman living in a penthouse apartment. Her sense of humor and tongue are sharp, but everyone other than family thinks she is a benevolent, sweet old lady. She confides that she hates it when people call her “dear" and talk to her as if she were a child. My job is to close the dog food, bread bags, and chip packages behind her, buy her flowers, and wipe down the walls and cabinets from when she lobs an empty can across the kitchen to the trashcan. :) She complains about how long she is living and any future plans for holidays or attending great-grandchildren's christenings are dismissed because “I will be dead by then.” The trouble with this statement is that she has been saying this since she was 40, and I observe that her DNA may be working against her plans, reminding her of her aunt who lived to be 102. Her commentary? “Ohh GOD.”
