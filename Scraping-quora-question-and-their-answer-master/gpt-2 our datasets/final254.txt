A normal day includes a repetition of already seen actions eg. having a breakfast, going to work, getting stressed and so on.Sometimes, from seeing too many normal days, you may experience a feeling of apathy, anxiety or even disgust (of living the normal mediocre life).Other than that, if you call yourself on a continual progress (on a daily basis), you may never have a normal day anymore.Working on yourself, your craft or whatsoever you track progress of, can and will assuredly make your day and life in general more interesting and exciting.There will always be normal days. You seemingly can’t have a completely different day than the one yesterday, but you can undoubtedly work on climbing on to being (not becoming) “proud but never satisfied” - a notion that makes life worth living.
