Well i set my alarm starting from 5:00 AM and give a gap of 2 to 15 mins and set another alarm ... this goes till 7:30AM. But thats of no use, i get up at 7:45AM, when my parents call me. :-P There was a day, during my exams i dint even wake up even after my parents called me 26 times!!! Then they called a wingmate of mine, who knocked the door.Then we BITsian usually take bath twice or thrice a week, depending upon the time we wake up.Have breakfast heavily.Then go to classes, if possible.Then just lay down in the classes and sleep or play some mobile games till the bell rings and continue the same in other rooms.During labs we take selfies and writing the record is the funniest thing!! I dont know who wrote the first record in BITS because its the last record written :-P, we all just copy that.Then come back to hostels and sleep until its snacks time.Then after snacks we all friends gather and just chit chat.Then we go to SAC to play sports or to gym.If its the time for mess registration, everyone becomes punctual than that we have to attend our classes.Have dinner.(Name Sake.....Waiting for ANC)Then play COD/GTA/DOTA/CS.If any quiz, one of our rooms becomes common room.Go to ANC(all night canteen).Then download and watch a movie from till 3:00.If possible, we will sleep. :-PIn one word- Lite!!
