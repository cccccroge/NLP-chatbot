I am not sure about other IIM's but at IIM A a typical day for a first year student starts at 8 AM when he/ she wakes up. Everyone has to be in class by 8.50 and since being late is not an option depending on how lucky you are, you get to have your breakfastThere are 3 classes of 50 mins duration with a ten minute recess after the first class. After class students head out for lunch and anxiously hope there would be no surprise quizzes. A surprise quiz would be announced at 1.30PM in the mess notice board and usually would be at 2.30 PM. After the quiz most people end up sleeping and their real day starts in the evening. Based on the clubs you are part of, you would be splitting your time between various clubs and, your study groups to prepare for the next day classes or completing your assignments. This goes on till late in the night punctuated with a midnight eating binge.Usually this is how a typical day is unless specific events like T-nite (intra college cultural event) are happening or it is before WAC assignment submission day :)
