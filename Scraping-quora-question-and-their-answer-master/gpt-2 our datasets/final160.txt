I live in a relatively liberal city. Only in suburban neighborhoods you will find conservatives (most of them are white and people often associate these conservatives with racism and extreme Christianity). My city is also 70% African American and BLM movement is still going on at school.I’ll describe what its like to be a conservative at my school.My school is really diverse and also quite liberal. When Trump became president people protested and walked all the way to the Walgreens parking lot next door to school. Then the people at Walgreens got annoyed and they kicked them out. I was the only Indian student who didn’t participate in the protest and a few classmates came up to me and asked me to join. I lied and said my ride was almost here.During our high school walkout, we had gun protesters and BLM people spreading their message too. I didn’t go and my excuse was that I wanted to do my school work.In AP World, we had a debate over gun control. My conservative friend said something in support of guns and a classmate threw her water bottle at her and everyone was hating on her for her remark.In another debate we were discussing how much free money should be given to the lower class. I was the only student who said that the United States was doing a lot to provide for the homeless/poor people. Classmates got angry and many called me ignorant and stupid. (From then on, I had decided to keep any conservative opinions to myself.)We also talk a lot about women’s rights at school and how women are not privileged in the work force. I usually just go along with it or don’t say anything.When people find out I’m conservative, they get somewhat shocked because I’m Indian or they’re like “Of course, you live in the white areas.”I also get a lot of comments like: Why would you like Trump? He’s gonna deport you and your family back to India.Most of the time I just accept what my liberal teachers and classmates say and I don’t talk about any conservative related topics at school just to be safe.P.S. My classmates/teachers are really nice for the most part. Some just have trouble respecting the beliefs of conservatives. And also I know the questions says “typical day” but no, this stuff doesn’t happen on a daily basis.
