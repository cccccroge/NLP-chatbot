My typical day involves working for somewhere between 6-10 hours. I might get lunch with a friend or go to a talk. I might have a meeting or two. I usually do some exercise activities. In the evenings, I might meet my friends for dinner or do some other social activities. I try to start working early enough in the day that I can spend evenings on my side projects.The further away I've gotten away from classes, the less typical my days are. I've learned that the fun part about being a Ph.D. student (as opposed to a software engineer) is that there are different kinds of days and (if you're lucky) you have some amount of freedom in choosing what kind of day you're going to have. Below I describe different kinds of "typical" days for a computer science Ph.D. students.Typical day when you still have classes. Younger Ph.D. students have some number of classes and hours of coursework to anchor their schedule. Classes have less flexibility when it comes to schedule and deadline, so when I was still taking classes I had a much more regular schedule. During that part of my Ph.D., I usually got up at some consistent time, went into the office to read papers, code, or work on assignments until class time, go to class, and resume my work activities. During these semesters I tried to work a solid 8 hours a day and usually took weekends off.System-building day. For most non-theory students, some parts of the Ph.D. are dedicated to building real systems. How much system-building there is depends on the nature of the projects a student works on. For me, system-building days tend to be longer because it takes longer to context switch in and out of a full system. These days I tend to work longer hours (often 12, maybe even 15). I'll also do fewer other activities on these days because it tends to be harder to think about other things.Thinking day. Some days I spend thinking about the direction of a project, which problems to solve next, or how to solve a particular problem. These days I'll usually go to the coffee shop or library in the morning with a notebook, "think" really hard (and/or read some papers) for a few hours, and then do some less thinking-intensive activities for the rest of the day. For me, "thinking" usually occurs in the morning and has never lasted for more than four hours. Conversations with other students confirms that this is fairly typical.Writing/talk-preparing day. I spend a much larger fraction of my Ph.D. than expected iterating over papers and talks to communicate about my research. Since this requires some amount of focus, I try to block out at least half-days for doing this. Sometimes this will be the second part of a "thinking day."Conference/travel day. Most Ph.D. students spend some fraction of their time travelling to/from and attending academic conferences. Different students have different approaches to conferences. Some spend the entire time sight-seeing (as they tend to often be in exotic locations), some spend the entire time in talks, and some spend the entire time in their hotel rooms. I see conferences as a fun opportunity to see the new work in the field and catch up with everyone. Conference days tend to be long days: I'll get up early, try to go for a run (often with ofter conference attendees), talk to people at the breakfast, maybe go to some talks, maybe talk to people in the hallway outside of talks, go to dinner with a group of people, and maybe go out for drinks and/or dancing after dinner. If you want to take full advantage of the social experience of a conference, it is important to be present for all breaks and meals. The good conferences are like giant sleepovers with all of your favorite researchers. At the last conference, a group of us went out for drinks and dancing after the conference banquet and then stayed up talking about programming languages research until 3am.Meeting day. Most Ph.D. students don't have many meetings: maybe the one a week/month with their advisor and then ad-hoc meetings with their collaborators. Ph.D. students involved with extracurricular activities or who manage many students will have more meetings. Many people I know with lots of meetings will try to fit their meetings in the same days(s) to leave as many days as possible for "real work." For me, meeting days will include at least 2-3 meetings with my advisor, my students, and/or other collaborators. I try to schedule these meetings on days when I already have research-related lunches or talks to go to. The other kind of typical day. Chris Parnin has a study about how programmers work that shows that they only occasionally have a "good" day. I would say this is true of computer science Ph.D. students as well. I have many days, especially after doing a lot of work, when I will not be particularly productive. I will come into the office, talk to my fellow Ph.D. students, write some e-mails, maybe go to a talk, read stuff, maybe refactor code and write tests, and maybe play around with my physical and virtual work environments. It is important for Ph.D. students not only to accept that they will have these kinds of days, but to view these days as productive in a different way. You can't be "on" all the time--and sometimes the best ideas come when you are operating at under 50%.For further reading, I have a blog post The Life of an Academic, Explained.
