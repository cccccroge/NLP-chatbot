I work as hard as anyone out there, but I'm not obsessive about it.  Nothing is gained in that last ten minutes that can't be gained tomorrow when my brain is  fresher.   I wake up when my daughter gets up, usually between 6 and 8.  Check the company bank account.  watch two episodes of something off Netflix (in the middle of Sons of Anarchy right now), make coffee, and play with my daughter.   I answer any overnight emails from my phone and confirm/edit my list of things to do for the day.  Head to the office by ten.  Finish my action items on my list by noon.  Spend two hours doing quotes and price checks.  Spend thirty minutes sending emails to people who have payments coming due.  Go eat lunch with the family.  Two hours for new quotes and action items.  Write down my list or things to do tomorrow.  Phone calls to partners, employees (all remote).  Cut purchase orders for pending items.  Double check my sales/buy sheet to make sure all deliveries are on schedule.  Recheck tomorrow's list.  Rinse and repeat.
