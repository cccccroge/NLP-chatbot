I have worked in several different places:Rural acute - report, do your patients' vitals, pour your first round of meds and give them out, help serve breakfast, do your assessments and morning care (as needed), then do whatever your patients need. You might have to take on a new admission, do discharge teaching, or monitor a mom in labour.Long-term care/palliative - report, pour your meds, give your meds, start your dressings, pour your lunch meds, give your lunch meds, pour and give your 2 p.m. meds, finish any dressings/treatments/whatever, pour your supper meds, give your supper meds...Outpost (yes, I have worked in northern Canada) - report, see the walk-ins from 9-12, lunch, public health clinics, be on-call or have someone else on-call until morning...Teaching - get in the door, prep anything you need for the first class, check your emails (or teach first; depends on the class time), deal with the rest of your emails, mark papers, prep for your next class, order your exams, volunteer to help proctor somebody's exam next week, input the marks from the latest exam, email everyone back their papers and make a note to bring the paper copies to the next class, start getting your stuff together for the class you have to teach next term...All depends on where you work.
