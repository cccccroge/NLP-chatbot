According to the Guide to the Constitution -The constitutional role of the Vice President is "to be available to become President" as well as "to be President of the Senate". These are the main duties and responsibilities, as interpreted and accepted from the US Constitution. Doesn't seem like much, huh? If the vice president did the absolute minimum as Vice President, this is what he'd do. If he were to actively assist the president where needed, the vice president would act as an adviser to the President, sit in for the President when he is unavailable for meetings, and other responsibilities as assigned to him by the President. His relationship with the President will dictate his extraneous duties.As for the exact day-to-day activities, it would depend on the person in office, of course. VP Biden may attend a press conference, spend time with family, or spend time with a hobby. Other times, he has to fly with the president to attend a diplomatic meeting or even stand in for him during the signing of a treaty. I guess you'd have to ask him to know the exact details. Here's his formal email, if you want to try your luck getting a response:vice.president@whitehouse.gov
