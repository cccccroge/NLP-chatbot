I'm sure the answer is different for everyone, but from my experience there is no such thing as a typical day with a narcissist.You never really know what to expect. It's like walking on eggshells, trying to figure out what appeases them and what sets them off. It could be calm and quiet until you look out the window. Then you become a “meat gazer”, lusting after the stranger walking by in the street. Or maybe you spent too much time in the bathroom, so you become worthless in all aspects of your home life. Don't close your eyes during sex or make a wrong expression, you might be thinking about someone else.One day you are the most beautiful angel to ever walk the earth. The next day you are ugly, you have a pot belly and no one likes you.Just when you think you might have a quiet family vacation, you can't be seen at the pool in a bikini.I can't stand you. I love you. I'm sorry. It's your fault. Here's some money, go shopping. Where have you been for so long. I hate you, whore. I love you. All in one day…And there will be days, weeks, maybe even months without the madness. You get used to the calm, but you just had to wear that dress in public…snap.Worship them and everything they do…snap.
