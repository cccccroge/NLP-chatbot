In pre-revenue and/or below $2.5 million in sales B2B startups, a great deal of your time is dedicated to face-to-face (synchronous) interactions.  There is a heavy weighting toward meetings with prospective customers (#1), strategic partners (#2) and key influencers [read: media, industry pundits and analysts].  This DIY mode is because your gene pool is very small with a flat organizational structure, so there are no layers of talent to act as your proxies.  Careful time management is required to maximize synchronous interactions such as grouping appointments to minimize travel time and expense.  Synchronous interaction platforms like Webex, GoToMeeting and Skype are helpful, but in a head-to-head solution bake-off, you must show the flag in person to be seriously considered against larger, more established competitors.  After all, a buyer in a formal supply chain-driven evaluation is looking to capture gains with the least amount of risk - and risk is the overarching factor.  It is really is an impossible task to outline a typical day in these type of startups, but one should anticipate a lot of road weariness before breaking through.  One should expect that there will be weekends spent away from home in a typical year to maximize time and save on travel expenses.  BTW, say good bye to Westin, W and Hyatt hotels, and say hello to Hampton, Fairfield and Holiday Inns.
