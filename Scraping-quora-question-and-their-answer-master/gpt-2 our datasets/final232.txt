Well, you just wake up one day and you wonder why he doesn't kiss you anymore before he lefts for work, or why he doesn't text or call you anymore to say he loves you. Instead, he demands silence all day. Sometimes you will have the guts to text him to say you love him, hoping he will say it back to you, but usually he’ll ignore you. Sometimes he'll be angry because you didn't do what he asked you to do: leave him alone.When he comes home, he acts like you're not there. He will have a drink, turn on the tv and wait until dinner is ready. He will not ask you how your day at work was, he will not give you a hug or a kiss and you can not count on him for any help or advice, because he's always too tired from work. He will not care about the fact that you work 5 days a week and also clean the house, pay the bills and shop for groceries all by yourself. Instead, he will call you needy and too emotional. Instead, he blows his money on drugs, alcohol and gambling. Instead, he cheats on you and he makes sure you know you're very low on list of priorities.That's it. You need to talk to him.But there you are, half an hour later. Sitting by yourself, crying your eyes out. You had another fight and he walked away from you, again. You tried really really hard this time, with carefully chosen words, to explain that you want to solve this together and that it's not meant as a personal attack. Still it was not enough. He will not listen to you nor understand you. He will ignore you for hours or days and even though it was not your fault, his words will sound so convincing that you’re going to doubt yourself. His silence ensures that you have too much time to think about mistakes you didn't make. So you will apologize and beg him to come back. And he will, eventually.For a moment you're happy, but not for long. You will have some good sex, but never a good conversation, because you're too scared he will walk out on you again. A couple of days go by and you’ll feel lonely once again. And so you continue your life without love, gratitude, emotional support, mutual respect and understanding.
