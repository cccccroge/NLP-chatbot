For a regular on the day floor nurse your day starts at either 7am or 7 pm.Followed by report. That can do alot of knowing if your day will be brutal or not so bad.In the day time you hit ground running in ensuring your patient didn’t die in the night or a procedure was overlooked or the patient was left somewhere no one knew about. Followed by getting baselines from the patients, getting meds in order and seeing that procedures patients have to get done in time for the doctors who make rounds are present and dealing with the politics of the day. While you’re doing this and (hopefully) the team you’re working with are all working on the same page know enough sense not to get into a pissing contest in front of the patient, you’re dealing with upset family, doctors who generally know that they are working with professionals and aren’t the last messiah. In addition you’re supposed to fit in testing related to care of the patient, any meetings, in services, and hand offs that are needed thru the day.Then you have graveyard,You get paid better, you actually get to know your patients, you a little “LESS” busy but you won’t be getting chances of sleeping on the job. You will learn more skills on being a nurse in graveyard than you will in daytime. You will also be treated worse in graveyard as most assuredly you will call someone, wake them up and get yell at for following their instructions, repeat that for 3 other patients on the floor for that doctor. You’ll see death more often, which is a good thing and you’ll have to learn to deal with it. Well, you think to your self graveyard is great I’ll just work that right!!! Well it comes with problems, you get paid better but you also never see sunlight you literally work sundown to sunup, you miss everything with family and friends, your sleep cycle goes into the crapper, you will be irritable and cranky generally, advancement is limited as the people who would promote you work daytime and promote from daytime alot. A lot of male nurses work graveyard for the specific purpose of not having to play politics in the hospitals and just want to be a nurse and go home.Hope that helps
