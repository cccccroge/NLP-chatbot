I woke up at 5am, 30 minutes before the alarm. Fed the dog. Let the dog out, then let her back in.Worked out for thirty minutes, took a shower, dressed. Cracked three free-range eggs and fried them for breakfast. Made coffee. Ate breakfast, then made coffee for my wife and served it her in bed. She’s retired now, so she gets a more leisurely morning..although today she had volunteered to drive a friend to an oral surgery appointment.Complimented her on how good she looked, even waking up, and what a good friend she was to drive 140 miles roundtrip, through Atlanta traffic, just for a friend.Drove to work. Worked through lunch. Ate a can of Mandarin oranges for lunch. Made a ton of phone calls. Talked with carpenter who's working on the investment property. Talked with the city. Talked with clients. Reviewed four proposals, worked on two more, reviewed plans. Too much work to take lunch. Heard Trump fired Tillerson. One less adult in the Trumpeter's playground. Pity. Tillerson is a good man.More work. Talked with both sons. Talked with college buddy and his wife. Scheduled a mini vacation for them at our house. Drove home from work.Complimented my wife on how good she looked.Went outside. Took chain saw from tool shed. Trimmed limbs from a tree that was overhanging the driveway of an investment property we’re preparing to sell. My wife helped with the cut limbs and was there in case I hurt myself. I didn't. Neighborhood kid came over to drag a few limbs out to the pile. He's maybe 9 years old. I give him a dollar. He's happy.Came back home. Put up the chainsaw.Fed the dog. Walk the yard with her. She’s getting old like me. Our old wounds are catching up with us.Listened to Hillary Clinton giving a speech in India about how women suffer because they listen to men, that she lost because Democrats don't get along with white males, and that she should have been more entertaining instead of being serious. My wife says “Perhaps, had she asked for her husband's input, she would have won the election. “Warm up some oxtail soup leftover from last week (I made it).Read from Nancy Isenberg's “White Trash. The 400-year Untold History of Class in America.”I'll close the evening out with one episode of Doc Martin from the BBC and a glass of good bourbon. And I'll say a prayer thanking God for all the blessings He's bestowed. I'll ask forgiveness for my shortcomings and I'll ask Him to help me be a better person.
