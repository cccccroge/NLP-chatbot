Typical day for me is as follows:Wake up at 5:30, lay in bed for another 20 minutes reading the news. If I'm really tired I sleep for 20 more minutes. I've been meaning to get up earlier to meditate and do yoga, but that has happened, like, twice. I then roll out of bed, eat breakfast if my wife wakes up early enough, and head to the office. During the commute, sometimes I pop in a conference call, but most of the time it is some audio book. I get in the office at around 6:30 and for the remainder of the day I do one of the following: 1. read2. speak/meet with management or sell side analysts (I try to keep this to a minimum, normally I don't like being actively misled). Sometimes I like to troll sell side analysts. 3. watch funny video clips on youtube, send them around the office. Sometimes I'll have a good stock related joke, and I'll come up with an excuse to tell it every chance I get.Â  4. Sometimes I'll have a good idea and I'll share it with my team. I get really sad when my ideas are ignored and they subsequently lead to a ton of theoretical profitably. When that happens, I mention it every chance I get. If it goes the opposite way, you will never hear it from me again. 5. After we are fully positioned, I began sharing the idea with buy side buddies, and try to get a good idea back in return. If they don't give me anything, I cut them off.I leave normally at 5:30 ish, unless it is Friday, then I leave ASAP.I don't work nights or weekends. "Work" stays at the office. However, I'm constantly learning about human nature, history and such, which is vitally important for my work. Qualification: analyst at a top performing fund.
