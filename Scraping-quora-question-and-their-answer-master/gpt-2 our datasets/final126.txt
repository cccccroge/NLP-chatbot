I’m usually up late - I watch Star Trek: Enterprise nightly, and live-tweet with friends whose political leanings I don’t inquire about, because Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations. One or both of my teens may be up; we homeschool, and all three of us tend to be nocturnal and do our best learning/creating in the wee hours.After Enterprise, I usually watch NYPD Blue and leave the television on while I write (this is a new pattern; my husband of over 2 decades died recently, and it’s lonely without him beside me, sleeping. I tend to go to sleep for a few hours around dawn, and get up a few hours later.I spend time with whichever kid(s) are up while I have coffee and make a plan for the day. I stay in touch with some other women writers via Twitter; we often cheer one another on as we share plans and accomplishments. I move into my day - some hometending, some administrative stuff (there’s quite a bit required for homeschooling in my state, and a tremendous amount after the death of a spouse, apparently).I do some reading, some writing, some cleaning. If the weather is decent, I might go for a 5k training. I eat, and eliminate. I laugh every day, and some days I cry.I focus on creating a stable environment for my kids, who have lost a great dad. I might go with my 16 year old as he practices driving in preparation for getting his license. I might go shopping (teens need to eat, after all). I might plan for future home improvements, or the puppies my daughter and I want to get in the spring, or worry about whether the roof will hold out until it’s warm enough to replace it, or dream of the addition that would give us a second bathroom, or play games, or gather things we no longer need to donate to those who can use them.I might play music and sing - I like to sing. If it’s Sunday, I will usually meet my local writer’s group at a Denny’s, for community and inspiration.Each day will include time with my kids, time spent trying to improve our circumstances and those of others, time for learning, and time for creativity.I hope this helps.
