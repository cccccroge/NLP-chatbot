I’m shaken into existence in the morning with two alarms ringing in a synchronous cacophony. I calculate the marginal utility of sleeping for one more minute (Act A), eventually deciding against it as my mind is contemporaneously calculating the probability of my missing class (Act B). I meticulously compute P (B/A) and then, cursing Bayes, compel myself to go to class to increase my knowledge Assets. However, attending the classes takes a big toll on the liabilities side of the balance sheet of my mind, as everything gets recorded in the ledger without being realized.  Post lunch, the betting game of the possible quiz ensues. The Wi-Fi bandwidth records the highest usage of the day precisely at 1:45 when everybody is glued into their mobiles. A minute of dread is followed by a bouquet of smiles as everyone congratulates one another, thanking their stars for having survived another day. I walk home a relieved man, confused about what to do as everything other than studies lie on my indifference curve. I get back to increasing my total utility and wake up to see 20 unread mails; I rise to foray into the night that is long and full of assignments.
