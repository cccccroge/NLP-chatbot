Same as the typical day of a conservative, I would guess. Except for the news. I get my news from a variety of sources: CNN, NPR, NYTimes, Economist, The Hill, BBC America News, and Huffington Post. I usually get my local news online from one of our main network TV stations. I believe that by getting my news from a variety of sources, I can actually get a more balanced picture of what is actually going on.When David Letterman interviewed Obama early this year, he asked Obama what the biggest cause of political polarization in this country was, and Obama went right to the root cause: He said that the biggest problem is that everyone isn’t operating from the same set of facts.This is very true, and it is something that has happened gradually. In 1971 future Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell wrote a memo to the US Chamber of Commerce - you can look it up and actually read it.

As the internet grew, we developed things like the Drudge Report, Breitbart and Red State.The problem with this is that about 30 percent of our population, the conservatives, aren’t really getting the real news. They are getting what the likes of the Koch brothers and the Mercers want them to get.This is very bad for our republic, because now most of the laws put in place, particularly by this current administration will help billionaires and large corporations, but mainstream Americans not so much.
