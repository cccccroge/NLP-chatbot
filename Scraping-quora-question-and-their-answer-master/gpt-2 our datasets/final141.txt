My father is relatively newly diagnosed. Maybe 8 months ago.He's in the early stages of the disease.Right now, @ 6pm he's just left to go buy cat food and dog food. Which he does about every two weeks.Most days he rides his bike early in the morning before we get up. Or he goes hiking. Returning around 10am.He smokes a cigarette and takes a nap until about noon. Makes something to eat and watches TV.SOME days he doesn't leave the house at all. Some days he rarely exits his room for anything.Some times he cleans the kitchen. The last time he did that he put dish soap in the dishwasher making a total mess in the kitchen. Suds everywhere.He plays hous guitar less and less. What used to be a daily activity is now maybe twice a week.I give him complete freedom and I don't involve myself in any of his business at all. One time he asked me to go shopping with him because it made him nervous. I happily went of course.His freedoms and abilities will certainly change over time but I refuse to take any independence away unless it's necessary.I definitely worry every time he leaves but I would destroy his happiness by keeping him cooped up and he'd be pissed off by it.I think he's not recognized my husband a few times which Is scaryâ€¦because that's a sign it's more advanced than im aware.
