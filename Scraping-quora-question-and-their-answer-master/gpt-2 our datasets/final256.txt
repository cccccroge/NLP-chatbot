I have a very healthy schedule. Get up early(like 11) then phone for 2hrs then Breakfast at 1pm, phone again till 5 then try to sleep but wont. Call a friend and hang out, come home around 8â€“9 then again tv series and after that dinner at 11 then i just go to my bed and try again to sleep but now its 4 and i am tired and take a nap.I want this to be my whole life's schedule. Dont give a rat's ass what is happening out there. And yes i read headlines online.
