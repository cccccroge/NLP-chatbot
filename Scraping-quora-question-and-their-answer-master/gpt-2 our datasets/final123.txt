I wake up around 5:20 from my mom's footsteps creaking around upstairs. I sit in bed for about an hour or so, occasionally falling back asleep, until my alarm rings at 6:17. I get up, turn off my radio, grab my book, and go into my living room, where I sit while I wait for my little sister to come downstairs and decide whether or not she needs to go to the bathroom ten minutes earlier than usual. I go into my house's only bathroom and get ready for the day. Today, I actually moisturized my skin for once, because it was particularly dry.At around 6:45, we leave the house. First we go to the elementary school for my sister, and then the middle and high school (they’re connected buildings) for me. There, I wait for my friends to arrive while I check my Quora notifications, read my daily news letter (it’s called The Skimm, I heard about it through my favorite podcast and I really like it), and check all the games I play that require a daily login to WiFi. When my friends actually get there, I choose to talk sometimes but usually just read Quora.I go to band, which is always a grand time. Our band teacher pissed about half the clarinets (literally three people) off, and currently we’re playing on exclusively chipped, 2.5 reeds and only playing a few of the accidentals. The other sections were snickering when she had us play a particular section of the Avengers.Then I go to Social Studies. I usually try to get through my work as fast as I can, because it’s incredibly easy. The teacher even said around the middle of the year that she likely wouldn’t teach some students (making eye contact with me) anything challenging this year, and so far that’s held. I’m aiming for a perfect 100% this quarter.Next is Language Arts. It’s alright, considering we’re not actually learning much at this point in the year.Then I go to Home Ec. About half the class just started the cooking unit, and we made pancakes on Thursday.Next is lunch. I eat food and make dirty jokes with my friends.Then I go to Composition, in which all I do is usually sit in the back of the room with the teacher and my friend Catherine. Sometimes she gives us food, so it’s pretty cool.I have Science next. Unfortunately, I recently developed a crush on the teacher and now it’s awkward. My favorite part is probably how I’m in the back with the ‘other’ (I’m not entirely, 100% sure I’m classified as one, but then again the two most behaved students of the class sit right next to us and likely act as a barrier) ‘problem’ (we’re really not that bad if you ignore how often we quote that “can I pet your kitties” vine).Last of the day is Pre-Algebra. Currently we’re doing the volume of spheres, and we haven’t actually had a lesson on it in class yet, so I understand little. Let’s be honest, I spend most of it watching the clock.Then I go home, where I eat food around 5:30 or so. My mom and I hang out in the living room until I shower around 8:00 and then we watch one of ‘our’ shows, Big Brother, Survivor, Young Sheldon, and Worst Cooks In America are our favorites. I go to bed at nine and then the cycle starts all over again.Somehow, my schedule is astonishingly similar to my more conservative friends. It’s weird.
