My typical day is:Make it to workPass through the various levels of security and enter my pin into a randomized keypad to give me access to a classified environmentGet to my computer and check emails, refresh on the tasks I should be doing or monitoringGet my music going and headphones onGet cranking on my work, usually either some coding, investigating missile failures, doing some machine learning or data analysis work, or running simulationsTake breaks every now and then for food,Â  checking out Stack Exchange to see what I can contribute to, updating coworkers on progress with tasks, or helping them with their tasksEventually leave and eagerly make it home to play with my dog and relaxI primarily work on missiles and develop various mathematically rigorous algorithms to help improve things related to the missile, from guidance to predicting missile performance, to other things.
