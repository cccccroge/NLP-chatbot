I am a school nurse. Every day is different. My role includes child protection meetings, health assessments and supervision, vaccinations for HPV, BCG and DTP, hearing tests, eye tests, referrals on, advice, signposting, teaching PSHE to all ages, looked after children assessments, common assessment framework/liaison, healthcare plans for those children with longterm medical conditions, Epipen training (i.e. teaching the teachers), prescribing. This list is probably not exhaustive. I currently cover 9 local authority schools so I have a lot of young people on my caseload - many of whom never need me but for the ones that do I find it very rewarding.
