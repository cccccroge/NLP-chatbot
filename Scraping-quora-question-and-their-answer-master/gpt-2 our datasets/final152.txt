We all worked so my aunt binged watched A LOT of her shows, movies, mini series.In the am, changed her, made her stretch, doing physical therapy exercises, fed her breakfast. Sometimes she felt cold in the am, so we would give her a bath pm.In the afternoon, my brother changed her before work, fed her, then back to her shows.Evening, same eat, meds, bath if not in am, change.She would see the drs at least 3 times a week. I'd run errands with her and push her in her wheelchair around the boardwalk. She had poor vision, so she couldn't really embrace the beauty of the ocean and beach BUT she loved fresh cut fries with cheese sauce and we would sit there, feel the sun, listen to the ocean and I'd talk about happy, silly, crazy family stories to make her laugh and boost her mood.When someone is sick or elderly, the best medicine is laughter and good vibes. They're going through a lot, if you make them forget and escape even for a moment. That moment could cause a domino effect for good vibes the rest of the day or week for them.So, basically it's like taking care of a child. Our elders kind of revert back to that state at some point. Just prepare for it, it will give you patience.
