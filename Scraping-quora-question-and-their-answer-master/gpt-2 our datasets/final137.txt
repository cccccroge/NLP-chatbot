My mom is 80. For six years, she lived on my property in my guest house. Initially, her days were spent doing projects. She’s always been a hard worker and enjoyed keeping busy. She hired a man to build her a green house, and nice raised brick beds for gardening, etc.As she declined, she was less able to see projects through to completion. She would putter. As she declined still further, she let the man go and hired a young 20-something guy one day a week to putter for her. Nothing was really accomplished, just puttering around the place. Then she’d complain incessantly at how she had to constantly watch the kid to make sure he was doing things the right way, because if she didn’t watch him, he’d screw up. (No surprise there—she lost what little of the local language she’d ever learned and was talking to him in English, a language he didn’t know.)She can’t read any more because she’s lost the ability to retain what she’s read so instead she listens to “alternate news” videos on YouTube. Videos that are an hour to 90 minutes long, she watches over and over and over again. In the moment, it makes sense and she can grasp what is being said, so it holds her interest. Then, she wants to get everyone else to come sit down and watch the video, too.When you turn the monitor so she can see it, too, she says, “Oh, that’s all right. I’ve already watched it several times.” And then she wanders away to the kitchen to make herself a cup of tea. If you want to talk with her about anything, it has to be on one of three subjects: 1) The latest conspiracy theory (think pregnant dinosaurs ridden by Nazis under the ice in Antarctica); 2) How horrible the world is, how evil the elite are, and how many children die of starvation every single minute which just goes to prove . . . 3) How soon Jesus’ Second Coming is. Surely, in the next 18 months at the most. Any other topic of conversation is a denial of faith that Jesus is coming soon.Unbeknownst to me, her mission in life had become one of my kids whom she horribly abused behind my back. As soon as I found out about it, I sent her to my brother in the US. Now, he’s livid because he doesn’t want to be bothered with the care of an elderly parent, although he’s single and has no dependents. She’s livid because she’s perfectly happy to stay here and continue to let me care for her all while abusing my child.But I can’t take care of her any longer. My time and energy must now be focused on helping my child heal.
