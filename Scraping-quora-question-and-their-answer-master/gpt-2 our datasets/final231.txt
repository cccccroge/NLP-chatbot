No day is typical, they all run a blur.But this hasn't always been the case.I used to smile, he used to love me. I was his everything as he was mine. We were the couple that everyone wanted to be. We were that love song that made your heart skip a beat. He was my forever. Was.Now twelve years later at the age of forty-seven the fog is lifting and this is how ‘ my ‘ typical day goes;I wake up in my bedroom at the far end of the house and rush to the bathroom to wet my face and pray that my eyes aren't as swollen as they feel. They are. I cry so much these days that swollen is really the new norm for me. I hurry up back to my room because I know he'll be stopping in to say goodbye and he loves me before leaving. I don't want to appear anxious or sleep deprived from crying all night yet again .As he leaves for the day he says ‘ I'll call you this afternoon ‘ , maybe we can go have a beer? Ok maybe I say, just give me a call. He leaves, everything is perfect. In his eyes anyways. It's all I can do now to keep my composure long enough for him to get out of the driveway before I fall apart again. He leaves, I crumble. The phone rings sometimes later it's a friend or my mom or somebody so I quickly regain my composure ( or so I think) and cheerfully answer the phone and go into ‘ old me ‘ mode . Happy go lucky, life is grand kinda thing. I don't fake emotions well at all so ‘ my ‘ act is just that an act.You see, this man, my love , my forever has just this year been unmasked for the narcissist that he is. So my days are tougher now then they have been for the past several years. For the past several years I've hated him and his self absorbed, self centered , egotistical all about me self. And was ok with that, because I was giving what he gave. Or so I convinced myself.I mean who really says they love you and yet stays in a separate room at the other end of the house for six years? Won't have sex with you because you ‘ me ‘ are giving it freely to everyone who has one in their pants, and even some that wear the same type pants I do. All the while he sits in his favorite bar eight hours out of every day. I of course work daily and then come home to tend to my daughter and all the animals we have, cook dinner and wait. Wait to see who is coming home tonight. Jekyll or Hide. Either one it doesn't really matter because they both create anxiety upon walking in the door.So now, after twelve years of complete confusion, smothered in lavish gifts , continuous denial , all the ‘ what the hell ‘ days and nights ,eggshell walking and the constant defending of my character I find myself broken. Broken for what? The fact that I was to blind to see? Broken because I didn't leave years ago, or broken because of the reality of who and what he really is ? Or broken because my heart is so big and the reality and knowing that what once was so amazing and my dream come true never actually existed. That what I experienced was possibly not even real. Broken doesn't even come close to what a day in my life with my narcissist is like. It's a torture unlike the other phases of hell.Almost like a scripted book my story is that of everyone else who has awakened to the fact that they are in a love with a narcissist, a character who doesn't even exist. Or do they? Was none of it even real? Surly it was. You can't fake a love like ours . Or can you? Was I sleep walking for twelve years? No , no he did all of those hateful hurtful things to me because he loves me. Why am I thinking like this, I'm the only one he's ever loved. I am his true love. His forever.Until.. the fog started lifting. Until I started testing him. Until he couldn't even give me a generic definition of what loving me ( or anyone for that matter) felt like. He was for the first time ever speechless. Confused, and drawing blanks for everything I was throwing his way. And I was throwing simple easily answered basic fifth grade stuff. Then my eyes started to open to what they refused to see for so many years. I was a stranger to his heart. His words said that I was his everything, his soul mate, his forever love. His eyes said nothing. How had I never seen his eyes? How had I missed so much. He was now a complete stranger . How did this happen? I need to see a doctor, this isn't really happening.So my answer to what is a typical day with a narcissist like is this: it is the most gut wrenching agonizing pain ever . It makes the devaluation stage look like a walk in the park . My reality is that of a fairy tale, because of course fairy tales aren't real. As my past twelve years haven't been either . This is the how my days are now that my narcissist has been unmasked. I wish this on no one. it literally has shaken me to the core and has me questioning my own sense of reality, I mean who was really living in a self made fantasy land? Him or me. How did I not see. Today I read my exact story over and over again only in someone else's words. It's scary to see it play out so vividly, and not just be someone else's story. It's mine. And mine is like all the others, heartbreaking. Surely I will wake up and this nightmare will be just that. A nightmare.
