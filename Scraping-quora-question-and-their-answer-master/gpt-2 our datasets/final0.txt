He does not have a fixed daily routine because he is travelling most of the time.He is vegetarian, and has more vegetables than cereals. He eats twice a day: at around 11.30 a.m. and around 7.30 p.m. However, recently I heard him say in a video that he eats only once a day around 4 pm so he eats well at that time.His sleeping hours have been erratic, but did not exceed more than two to three hours every night. In a video he also said recently that now a days he is sleeping a bit more but still not more than 4 hours. Generally he sleeps somewhere after 12 to 2 am.I have read that he does one surya namaskar and ‘20 seconds of yoga’ (Because he can activate the energy body directly without using breath and body as a means.)He has also said that he has to take a bath at least 2–3 times a day specially if he is with a lot of people, like in a program.When he is in the ashram, he often joins inmates for a fierce game of evening volley-ball and other games.He has also said that if he is sitting and talking after his meal, his pulse is around 56–58 but if he sits silently, without having had his meal, his pulse is around 34–36!A true yogi!Source: Sadhguru’s videos and The Way of the Masters - Life Positive
