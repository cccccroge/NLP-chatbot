8:42 A.M. “…tuck in your shirt afterwards… For now just run!”; grasping yet running. 8:45 A.M. (The feeling of reaching out to Juno probe and then back in a jiffy; eyes wide open) 10:00 A.M. Thank God he woke me up just in time!!Well if you’re thinking that life in campus begins at 8:42 A.M., then kindly consider the time when you know that you have to wake, but you’d prefer to yield to the Holy Goddess of Laziness…well, Amen! The “started college at IIM-Ahmedabad” week witnessed cheerful days and blissful nights. The prep junta had already started mingling quite too often and these flocks could be seen chirping at around CT and Tapri. PGP-1 survivor was witnessed as an ardent soldier and deserved to be first served; lest some with zero work ex weren’t sure of the ragging or the no-ragging norms! The funkiness of the well-groomed hair had now been matted, probably because of the numerous casemats and the “call” that ran shivers across the body was prayed, so as not to be the day’s fate! Whatsapp group came to life by 2 P.M. with standard buzzes being “wake me up” and meet-ups for assignments, as one could see the fire incinerating slowly. And then as there was Room 101, which was the worst thing in the world or Voldemort, he who must not be named; so IIM-A presented the notorious 1:45 P.M. And as Pheidippides, bought the message from the Battle of Marathon, one could see the same unmerciful looks in the eyes of the PGP Messenger aka Jallad. With exactly an hour for the bomb to go off, and black-book turning white- one often ended up blackmailing the Almighty for special considerations.The whole “globe” was rasterized in a two dimensional study material entitled UPO, whose dimensions were unknown. If FRA fractured the body and WAC whacked the mind off, one used to rejoice occasionally in blaming the poor HRM theory which stood by itself in face of its revengeful critics! And after all classes got over, all loitering been done, and all “favours” been sorted, the deep groan of dorm dog could be heard that perhaps heralded the coming storm. Mostly the dorm or the study group junta will drag you to the deadline in all assignments and of course will make you sip the cold (ordered hot) coffee at 2:00 A.M. in CT, much against your wishes. But deadlines are sacrosanct and so are dorm/group unity. And then came the final exams, Ohh yeaah! Term 1 is finally ending, Phew!!, and thanks for the Jaiswal tea for reviving the senses in the exam hall. The last exam, and even before one had barely rolled the last exam paper out of a mixed feeling of excitement and frustration, one could see some Facchas carrying books on Operations, Statistics for Business and Economics, Principles of Corporate Financing….wtf! Cared to check the mail? 12:48 P.M., exactly 18 minutes after the exam ended, there was this mail to collect the Slot 2 materials from Publications Office. Rubbed the eyes, but even before that T-Nite junta had started clamouring in whatsapp groups, directing attention to crucial things. Certainly no time to think! Thanks for the grind!The campus is wifi-enabled everywhere, lest the under pass which instead takes us back to the initial days of the institute with the pictorial representation narrating the story. During lecture breaks there are discussions, pep talks, random chit chats covering many other domains including accusing time, deadlines and CAT!! But the section folks always bring a smile on your face and again they are the ones who would least mind to steal your CP marks!By the end of slot 1, T-Nite united the section and the “joose-es” united the batch! Different we were, with distinct abilities, but now IIM-A is a family; motivation down, motivation boosted; experiential learning secured 24×7 and with the to be best buddies around! Proud to be a WIMWIan :)the Secret door
