It’s sweet and nice when you greet them after a small absence. You get those little butterflies and your cheeks swell from all the smiling. You get lost in that person and everything surrounding them is just white noise. You walk around holding hands planning your future and all that happy things you both look forward to.But then.. as the skies turn grey and the wind starts to blow a little harder here comes something unexpected. All of a sudden they become over whelmed by something you said or didn’t say. Your love has now transformed and is upset. You ask what is wrong. What can you do to fix what upset them. But then you’ll get asked why you did what you did to upset them. And as you are wondering why they feel the way that they do they’ll unexpectedly not say a word to you. Nothing but silence. The more you beg and plead for an explanation as to their new disposition they begin to seethe and ignore you some more. Then as they escape into their dark stonewall realm, you’re in agony as to why the love of your life is dangling your heart from atop this stone wall castle. Making you feel worse and worse about what you did. And you beg and plead and promise not to ever do it again. They will slowly open those stonewalls and let you back in. Then you’re at peace and all the bad feelings will go away and now the both of you are back in love.The next day..See the paragraph above.
