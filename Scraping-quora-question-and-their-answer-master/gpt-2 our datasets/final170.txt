What is a typical day of a conservative like?Are you sitting down? I hope so, because you may not be able to handle the extremes we go to on a daily basis. They are like nothing a liberal can imagine. Most days are the same, but I will tell the tale of my day today.0445. Alarm goes off. I get up, quickly get ready for work. Brush teeth, shower, and get dressed.0500. Get in my car for the hour drive into work. Yep, I go to work at a job. I even got to negotiate my pay and benefits at said job before starting many years ago.0600. Arrive at my office, power on my notebook, and get a cup of coffee. During this time I’ll see if any new taskings have arrived in my inbox and start on my routine tasks or any lengthy tasks that might take multiple days.1000. Have a meeting with coworkers and go over anything we are working on that others may need to be aware of.1010. Get back to my desk and get back to work.1100. Eat a protein bar at my desk because I’m not that hungry and I have work to do.1300. BS with coworkers about a whole lot of nothing for 10–15 minutes.1315. Back to work. Dammit, this connection is slow as molasses today. It’s preventing me from getting everything I need to do done in a timely manner.1500. Still have work to do, but I can finish it up tomorrow or later tonight if I have time. I’m on my way back to my car and on the road for home.1630. Just arrived home. Traffic home is always worse than to work. I kiss my wife and get into her SUV and head to the home improvement center.1700. I found the perfect brand new porcelain throne to fulfill the promise I made to replace our old one.1715. Arrive back at home. Unload the new command chair for the fortress of solitude and get to work at removing the old one.1730. The wife leaves to pick up our kids from their after school activities. Yep, real live kids. We try not to squish them when they’re just a “clump of cells” or let them develop a bit so they can be ripped apart to for some “doctor” to be able to make their Lamborghini payment.1830. I’ve finished the installation of our meditation seat and get cleaned up.1845. I throw some flank steaks on the grill while my wife gets the rest of dinner ready.1900. Our family sits down at the table and eat our meal together and go over our days.1930. Get dinner cleaned up and sit down to relax. I’ll browse Quora for a bit and find a question that gets my attention to answer.1945. It’s Monday so we stream the latest Walking Dead from last night. It’s really cool how much we can relate to the survivors surrounded by mindless zombies. It’s like every day living as a conservative.2100. Time for bed. Most everyone will hit the hay for the night. Finally a bit of quiet time alone for me. Perfect! I wanted to catch up on some work.2230. Time to rack out. It’s a whole new day tomorrow.There you have it. The crazy, weird, extreme day of a conservative.
