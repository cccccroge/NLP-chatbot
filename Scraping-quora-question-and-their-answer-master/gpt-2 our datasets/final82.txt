The typical day routine depends on what kind of student you are/ wanna become.Studious - These people focus more on studies and future since beginning. They wake up so as to bath/or not have breakfast and reach class by 8am. Take a nap in afternoon and attend classes till 5pm. Then playing something or doing other stuff and sleeping by 11–12 am max.Casual- They take few classes and skip few. They focus more on gaming/ campus events like fests and all/ spending time with friends/ sports.Ultra Lite- They hardly go to classes (except few labs). They take an oath of not attending any classes and plan to do everything in room like gaming or “few wrong things”.I think people here can be broadly classified in these three categories only.Now schedule of campus is-7.30–9.30- breakfast in mess, except sunday (sunday its 8–10)8am-5pm- classes in academia block (every student is scheduled to attend 4–7 classes of one hour each within this time)11:30am-2pm lunch in mess(though half the campus doesn't eat it)5–8pm seniors or some experts from outside conduct workshops which are always helpful to some or the other4:30–6 snacks time in mess7:30–9:30pm dinner in messApart from this indoor playground (SAC) is opened in morning and evening (don't know the exact time 6:30- 9am, 4pm-9pm) for indoor games and jym. Playground is open all time for cricket, football, hockey, volleyball etc.I hope u got ur answer.
