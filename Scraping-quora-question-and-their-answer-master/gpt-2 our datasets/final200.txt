Interestingly, the key to your question lies in one of the words you chose: professional. In an interview, bestselling author Ryan Holiday described a typical day of writing for him:"To me writing is a job, a profession, and the best way to be a professional is to set professional hours. So I don’t cram, I don’t do spurts when inspiration strikes, I don’t do it in a bathrobe or from bed. I write every day and I treat it like work. I am sharpest and least imposed on in the morning so that’s when I write. I have a ritual: I get up, I shower, I get dressed as though I am going to a job and then I show up to work. I write in a journal first. I play with my son. And then I sit down and tackle whatever writing I have assigned for myself that day. I start at around 8—9 at the latest—and by 11 or 12, I am pretty much done. The rest of the day is for whatever other work I have and then the evening is for family, friends, hanging out, whatever. I can think of maybe a handful of times tops that it’s ever been dark outside—unless because it’s that early—that I have found myself writing. And those times were probably because I had jet lag or I was lightly editing something that was already in production."In many ways, the typical day of a professional writer looks like the typical day of any professional.
