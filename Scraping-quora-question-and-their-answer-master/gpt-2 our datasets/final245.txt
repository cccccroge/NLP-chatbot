A typical day with a â€œ Narcissist, there are many arguments, because they are very selfish. You cant have any deep conversations; because they are mentally weak and can't take consructive criticism. You are constantly, trying to come, at different angles; because you know they are easily offended and it could lead to arguments or worse. They only want to communicate, when it benefits them. They are big liars, because deep down, they have low self-esteem and very insecure about themselves. Even if they are offered treatment. They will refuse, because they are to weak and selfish to recognize their flaws. All in all; they only care about themselves. Although their actions hurt family, kids and significant other. They dont care, because they believe everybody and life has to cater to them.
