You wake up. If it's a good day in that narcs bed (even if you are just friends, like in my case). Probably no good day, fight the night before, whatever. You think about how to behave today to not get them angry. You start walking on eggshells. They take hell of a time in the shower, you are late, can't shower. They decided they would Go first, again. While they shower you put your clothes into the washing machine. They get out of the shower.tantrum. “I wanted to wash today! You are making uge inconvenience for me!” “okay, you want me to take it out? Is it urgent?” — “no you just Don't get it"You drive to Uni together, sit down. Narc asks “do you want to get coke?” meaning you get up get coke for them. Not them getting sth for you.After that class, you have class without them. It's almost twelve. They have 2 hours of work after that, you have two hours of work at two.They text you. Not because they wanna hang, but because you could bring them food?…You get home from work at 4. They have been in their bed for 2 hours. They ask you if you can go to mcdonalds for them. If you say no, they Could go themselves, huge tantrum.You have to study. They go to a Party. When they get home in the night they scream at you and blame you. For starting to study without themThat was after 2 years with a narc, and my life has been like this for a year. Then I ran away backs packed in the middle of the night And threw her out legally from a safe distance. I had to live with friends for 6 weeks but no matter on which sofa, it was better than this and I felt free again. I felt loved and whole. To this day.
