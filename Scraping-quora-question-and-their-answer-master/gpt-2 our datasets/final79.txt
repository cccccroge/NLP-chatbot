I can give 3 different examples, of 2 of my batchmates and me.. 1) Let me start by the most studious guy I know.. He will never read this but his friends might show this to him.. He wakes up somewhere between 4:30 to 5:30 in the morning, takes a bath and starts studying.. He studies till class starts, has regular meals at regular times, studies in between classes, and sleeps somewhere between 10 to 11 every night.. He loves it and is happy with his life.. His biggest worry is not understanding a concept in class, missing one note the teacher teaches and everything else is lite for him..2)Then there comes the guy who has been next to me since the day I joined BITS(in terms of rooms) He takes all the tension of the world onto himself at times.. He tries to attend every class but misses almost 20 percent as he does not sleep on timehis main concern is CGPA which hurts him all the time..3) I avoid studying.. I only play games.. My day starts at lunch and ends at breakfast.. I strictly follow the eat sleep dota repeat path.. I have no concern in my life and my future is very hazy right now.. It really is your wish what routine you want to follow.. All the three above routines are bad in one way or the other but their followers still follow them.. This answer may seem like what not to follow in your college life but then again some of the answers here really include absurd statements like- "I light some incense sticks" coz technically you might as well smoke 2 cigarettes.. P.S. Made it anonymous coz I have changed myself.. a lot..
