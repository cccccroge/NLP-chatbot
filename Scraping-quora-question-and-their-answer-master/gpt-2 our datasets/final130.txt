I HAVE NO ELDERLY PARENTS, No elderly siblings, No elderly spouse. I do have some elderly children, however, and so feel qualified to answer as a post-elderly person.I am an 87 year old widower. I have 7 children, 21 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. The eldest great grandchild is now 21 years old, so he will soon obey the Lord and “go forth and multiply”. I can no longer help. -I am also a disabled veteran.-I arise between 3 and 4 a.m. to attend to bodily functions. At this time, I take my daily dose of metamucil. I return to bed and rest a while. I awaken about sunrise and attend to bodily functions, weigh myself, bathe, and swallow six of my 17 daily medication doses. I go to my daily calendar to see what events are scheduled for the day. The most frequent events are: hospital or doctor visits, scheduled chess games, visitors, trips to post office or market - for which I need transportation- (I also have Alexa remind me of special events, such as my aqua therapy or holidays and birthdays,. I decide between breakfast or brunch, to prepare as momentarily desirable, or to eat elsewhere . When I have a visitor, I take them to lunch, (or to dinner) otherwise I prepare them myself at the proper time, I then take more medications and sometimes a nap. I pick up my mail a couple of times a week. It is only about 400 yards to my mailbox, and it passes my barber shop and my bank; so I can often kill two birds with one stone. I do cut my own hair and trim my own beard, sometimes my elder daughter helps me; but like to have a professional touch-up occasionally.When I do not take a nap, I go to Quora for about an hour. I currently play chess on the web, but am about to end my playing days. If it is a weekend, I may have visitor(s), when a visitor is here at mealtime I always invite the person/people to a meal at one of my four-star restaurants in the village, the snack bar, the cafe or the cafeteria, their choice, (all also in my village.) In bad weather I do my own cooking. I brought some of my appliances from my old home, including a rotisserie. I cellar about 300 bottles of wine so that I can have the right wine with whatever the meal should be. The eateries are tolerant of me bringing my own wines. for dinner, which I usually cook for myself when it is for me alone, or for a special occasion, and sometimes for visitors if I know they are coming and will enjoy the dish I will prepare. If invited to dinner or other similar event, I bring the wines.Alone most evenings, I answer e-mails and handle upcoming birthday or greeting cards, and revisit chess and Quora. I reserve Friday evenings for a lady friend. After Friday dinner we sit on my patio and enjoy soft music, converse, and a glass of wine. I take my medications, perform my evening ablutions and go to bed after adjusting indoor temperature, door locks, window shades, and adorning bed jacket and/or pajamas.When I get no evening visitor(s), I watch television until I fall asleep, when I awaken I go to bed because I must arise between 3 and 4 am for my bodily eliminations and my metamucil.There are times when I must see a doctor, I have seven. One is in the village, and I walk there, my dentist is also in the village. My neurologist is about 15 miles away and one of my sons always takes me on a Friday. My other doctors are all at a hospital about 13 miles away, and one of my other children, usually my elder daughter, usually takes me to the hospital. She lives 90 highway miles and one bridge distance from me, and i usually see her on Tuesdays when she drives me to hospital, grocery, and/or pharmacy, She is a dressmaker and adjusts my clothing to fit and repairs small tears, buttons, or shortens. A granddaughter or a neighbor drives me to my wine store, when I need to refresh my stock. On pleasant evenings I sometimes sit on my patio with a glass of wine and friends come by to join me in a glass, back-ground music, and discussion.On special holidays such as Christmas, St Paddy’s Day, and October Fest, I can always get family members to drive and enjoy the festivity with me. My lady friend does not drive, so I sometimes arrange a foursome (One being the driver).Life is good. No difficulties, no worries, no serous problems, and Heaven before me. I wish you peace and happiness. lk
