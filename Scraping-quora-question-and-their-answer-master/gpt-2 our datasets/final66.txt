While Deepak's answer perfectly captures the daily travails and brings back memories, would like to add a few things that were different 10 years ago.The surprise quiz notification used to happen at 1:05 pm (while we were attending the last few minutes of the class).There used to be a small window from where students from only two particular seats could make out whether or not a quiz notice is being put up outside the classroom. At 1:05, all eyes in the classroom used to be at the folks on these two seats to check if there was any surprise quiz that day.The quiz used to start at 1:45 pm.So, if there was a quiz, 1:10-1:45 pm had two scenarios:Case 1:Have lunch and give the quiz without any prep (ideal, but rarely considered as an option).Case 2:Skip lunch, rush to your room and lookup last year's quiz papers.Once the quiz ended (2:30 pm), you could either:Grab a bite at the cafeteria (as mess would have stopped serving lunch by then) and then head back to room.Grab the customary cup of tea with friends (often complemented with a maska* bun) at one of the many tea stalls outside the campus gate.While missing breakfast every day for the additional 30 min sleep was quite the routine, maska* bun used to be served during the tea break after the first session, and that kept us going for the remaining 2 sessions.In our days we never spent 10 hours in the library as seems to be the case now. Most of it was spent in the dorms.* Maska = butter
