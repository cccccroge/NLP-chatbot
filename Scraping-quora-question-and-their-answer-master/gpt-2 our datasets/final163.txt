I run a 12 people digital marketing agency. To summarize, this is how I spend most of my days when I'm not swamped with client meetings. 1. Accounts- Check accounts receivables- Check expenses and money I owe- Check various reports in quick books ( Company health)2. Projects- projects and action items- project management - project milestones, time spent vs budgeted time, more reports3. Sales - CRM- Enquiries and quotes to be sent- Leads- Project pipeline and forecast4. To do lists5. Check emails- Morning - After lunch- Before leaving for the day6. Read blogs and sometimes write one when I get time.
