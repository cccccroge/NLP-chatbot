I dont know about others, but here is what my day looks like:(pre-requisites for each day: proper knowledge of important lectures and class for next day):1. Wake up accordingly. If there is early class, wake up at 7:30am, breakfast and everything.2. After attending class, and there is a 2-3 hour free stretch, Open Laptop and Run DC++, type +uploads and download all the stuff which I find worth watching.3. Study for any lab evaluatives scheduled for the day later.4. Class get over by 5(techincally it ends a lot earlier for me)5. Short trip to gol gappe at c'nnot or maggie at Hostel Redi6. occasional club/dept work7. some tv series or movies, study a bit for next day's exams or lab evaluatives.8. Some more stuff searching on DC++ which is related with area of interest like AUTOMOTIVE etc.9. copy some episodes or songs in phone, sleep while watching or listening.
