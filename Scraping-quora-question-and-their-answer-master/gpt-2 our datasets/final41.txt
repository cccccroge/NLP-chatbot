Well, it's been over 15 years since I was in medical school, but I have a feeling things have not changed too dramatically. Let's dig into the memory banks...The first two years of medical school are primarily composed of lectures, practical/clinical modules, and exams. My medical school did not require attendance for lectures, but it's not something you should skip unless you're brilliant and self-motivated. The hours varied greatly depending on what was scheduled for the day. Before exams, many would study from daybreak till after dinner for up to a week. There's a ton of information to absorb during these years. The third year of medical school includes rotations on different medical services, such as emergency medicine, internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics, pediatrics, etc. You have to be very adaptable because things can change from month to month. It's your job to be reliable and inquisitive during this year.The last year of medical school continues rotations on different services. But you get to choose most of them because you have to decide on which specialty to pursue. Many rotations can be done at outside facilities. This gives you an opportunity to shine at places where you wish to do your residency. You only get matched to one residency location after medical school, so you want your top choices to rank you highly.Third and fourth year days can be pretty demanding because you want to wake up early and never be late to your rotations. And you still have to study for exams, including the different steps for the board exams. But they're nothing compared to your residency days. ;)Hope that gives you an overview. It's much more detailed, of course. Perhaps someone who's done it more recently can add more.
