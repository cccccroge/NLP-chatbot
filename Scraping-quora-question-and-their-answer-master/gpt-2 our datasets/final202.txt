As Software Engineer, my typical day is like this:08:45 - sit at my chair, turn my 2 monitors on and make a little pray;  08:45 - check my emails;09:00 - define my daily goals: need to fix this, finish that, etc;09:05 - start coding;11:00 - little pause to refuel water-bottle and breathe some air;11:05 - back to code;13:00 - lunch;13:45 - check my emails;13:50 - take some time to read news/Quora/SO;14:10 - back to code; 16:30 - little pause to eat some fruit, refuel water-bottle and have a leak;16:40 - back to code;19:10 - finish work - check what I did and what I couldn't.19:15 - check my emails;19:30 - thank God to another good day of work and drive home;Sometimes I had no time to quora/so, because replying emails can take too much time. But I try to take at least 5 min to read some news.Other days I can't take 45min to lunch, often because of some deadline or other urgent problem, so I eat some fruit/juice within 10 min, and back to code again.In general, is not a stressful day, because I just love what I do.PS: no coffee at all!Edit 1: Coding =  thinking, researching, interacting with other programmers, white board prototyping... and finally.... typing (wearing headphones).Edit 2:I'm very surprised with what people are saying about my "work-day" routine. Some are complaining about I leak once a day. Others are saying I "pray" to have no bugs  because I don't do testing. How can you I have no meetings at all? How could it be?Unfortunately, somebody said that I'll just die in 2 years, 'cos anybody can work this way... Well, this has been my routine from last 10 years, and here I am. And yes:- I do testing (for each hour spent writing code, 2 hours of testing);- I pray to God to many things, including to help me doing a good job;- I use to leak once/twice a day (while in work-time). At home I use to leak many times more.- I have meetings, but not every week and they are very (very) short (10/20 min tops).I'm sorry if my routine doesn't fit into life-style or if looks pretty bad to your eyes.
