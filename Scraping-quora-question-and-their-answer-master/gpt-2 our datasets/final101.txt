Firstly depends on where in the world you are. Being stationed east of most exchanges is a very nice luxury considering the amount of night sleep you have. Then it depends if you are a trader, quant or analyst. I myself am a quite fresh algo-quant, so on the top of things you probably couldn't tell me a part from a computer programmer except that I have to wear a suit most days.Sometimes a quant has to walk a few stairs down to our trading desk if the traders see something suspect or a system crashes.Occasionally "the nerds" are taken in by sales guys to meetings with current or prospective investors for credibly and added market review. Most quants hate doing sales meetings though.Once in a while there is a due diligence visit where some investor sends guys over to check that there is a credibile operation in place where they are to put their millions. There has been a clear upswing in those after Bernie Madoff. Even in completely legit operations such as the one I work in there is a bit of nervous tingle in the air those days.Lastly I usually have a market briefing/seminar by some bank or research agency once every two weeks or so. Very commonly they buy you breakfast or lunch, show you what their analysts think of the markets, all in the hope that I will channel them more business. Being on the buy side in finance gets you quite a lot of freebies.
