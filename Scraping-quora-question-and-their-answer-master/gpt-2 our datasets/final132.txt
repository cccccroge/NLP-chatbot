I’m not sure if my dad is elderly. He doesn’t seem elderly although the calendar would indicate that at 84, he may be elderly.Yesterday morning he woke up in Europe on the last day of his river cruise. Last night he called me around 7 p.m. from the local highway to let me know he was back and headed home. Knowing the time difference between the Danube River and the Carolinas, I asked if he was heading to bed when he got home. “No. I’m going to unpack and get my laundry done.”Today he would have made his regular Saturday afternoon Pinochle game at the club. He usually doesn’t golf on the weekends so he probably did his 3.5 mile walk this morning when it was still cool outside.Tomorrow is Sunday. On Sundays, he usually attends a dance and at least one Sunday a month, he attends and sometimes hosts a social with his neighbors.Monday morning he’ll be on the golf course. Monday evening, he’ll play poker. In between, there will probably be a game of pool and possibly a trip to the gym.He may opt to walk instead of go to the gym because hunting season is coming up and he’s planning to drive out west and go elk hunting. He wasn’t drawn for a tag so he isn’t sure if he’ll be driving to Arizona, Montana, or Idaho, possibly Wyoming. He needs to be in shape to be in the high country. He does use pack horses instead of a backpack these days.You’ll get a better picture if you see the week rather than a single day.Golfing 3 - 4 days (sometimes scoring less than his age - In July he got a 79 - definite bragging rights for an 84-year-old)Dancing - ballroom dancing twice a weekShag dancing lessons - this is new - once a weekPoker Games - at least two games, up to fourPinochle - 2 games a weekPool - varies, wins some tournamentsGym - at least 3 days a weekWalks (3.5 miles) - at least 3 days a weekEntertaining - having people (family, friends, or neighbors) about once a weekTravel - as desiredConversation with daughter - daily if he’s home by 10:30 p.m.House cleaning, laundry, and yard work - as neededAttending plays - about once a monthShooting and Volunteering at the gun range - periodicallyVolunteering for RMEF — as needed to support annual banquetNow you know why I don’t equate my dad with being elderly. He’s just nicely seasoned.
