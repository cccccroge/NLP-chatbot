You deal with lots and lots and lots of cars on the way to work, unless you’re like me and could go to work super late like after 11am. Otherwise, you won’t have a nice time unless you love traffic.Get to work, check emails, do workLunch, with others if you’re the social type, and by yourself if you can’t be arsed.Work some more.Evening hours having you checking Google Maps to see just how bad the traffic is, and how many accidents are on the road courtesy of people who don’t know how to drive properly in this country. Perhaps they honed their road skills elsewhere, who knows. But the fact is, on the 88o there are accidents EVERY, SINGLE, EVENING, without fail.Time to deal with traffic on the way back home. How bad it is depends on how many accidents are along the way and how early or late you can get on the road. If you try to be early, maybe get on before 3pm. Good luck. Or, if you’re like me, wait until at least after 7pm.Go home and eat a really late dinner if you’ve had a long commute or if you just go home late to avoid that traffic.Go to sleepOh did I mention traffic?
