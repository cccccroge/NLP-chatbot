What is the typical day like with a narcissist?Unpleasant. Unless what you want to do is what they already had planned, and you don’t find anything wrong with anything they like and want. I have to say that a narcissist, when everything is going their way and they are on the happy side is just like being with anyone else. The last guy I was with was quite charismatic and just plain fun when he was in a good mood. It’s hard to understand why anyone would stay with someone like that, but you just keep hoping there will be more good days, because the good days were really very, very good. Anyway, just let the day deviate from what he had planned or what changes he could handle, just even a little bit and that’s when all the sane people walk out the door. It took me a little while the last time, and now I really would rather not ever be in a relationship at all than be in another with a narcissist.Whatever goes wrong is my fault, whatever doesn’t please him is my fault. My birth father was violent, my first relationship with a narcissist wasn’t, but my last one got scary toward showing me the type of simian dominance displays my father did before he got violent.Ok, and I’ll throw my 2 bits in on the abbrev. thing: “narc” is pronounced “NARK” not “NARS” and makes no sense as a pronounceable abbreviation for narcissist. That could be just me. Probably is, but I had to say it. It’s like a tic; I can’t help myself.
