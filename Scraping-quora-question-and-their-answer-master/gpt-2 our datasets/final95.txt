I work at a hedge fund. Not much pressure; small team with 200M in assets. Quant driven.8:30~8:45 wake up .....don't follow news, so no need to waste time following reports, etc. I'm usually on the subway by 9, listening to my ipod. 9:30-10:00 in office, go down to get breakfast. bring up and eat in office, jokes with colleagues.10:00-12:30, read research papers, implement new ideas. chat with boss and colleague about ideas. (boss gets in at like 10-10:30)12:30-1:30: lunch, chill, if we go out to eat, we get back at 2:002:00 -4:30: meet with boss about research, implement new ideas, code.4:30-7:30: boss leaves, do my own research for my own account...if don't feel like it, go out with friends to eat and watch movie. If everyone is busy (usually the case), I make dinner and play COD. 7:30-11: watch a movie, relax, and do some research. I'd have to admit that as long I don't grow tired of what I do, im pretty chill. Theres never the need to work extra hours compared to the other guys who go IB or fundamental portfolio management. We are systematic, quant asset allocation. Note we can also take time off or work at home lol. Perks, free friday breakfast. When we go out, boss pays for everything. Client meetings for me when the client is more technical. I get paid 100k base.
