Constant learningCreativity under pressureMeticulous attention to detailStrict adherence to procedures (often poorly communicated to you)Regular meetings, though sometimes as few as one a week.Lots of computer work, typically dealing with specialized software.Typically not a lot of actual in-person communication with real people, and when you do, it is usually with people that have poor social or communication skills.You work on projects that are usually months to years long, but with lots of milestones to track your progress to make sure you are on schedule.Usually most engineers of every sort spend a lot of time over computers and prototypes, working with complicated software packages and equipment, being creative and productive under terrific pressure, generally isolated from people.If you are a typical successful engineer, you will be intelligent and focused, have poor social skills (perhaps by your nature or because of lack of practice) and driven to create, but generally not in an artistic sense.  Companies want to make use of this, but in an incredibly predictable and no-risk manner.  Failure is typically seen as incompetence, though intelligent managers realize there are worse sins than occasional failure.So, yes, there is good pay, high potential and the opportunity to create things that will affect countless lives, but too often it comes with almost constant high pressure and increasingly difficult standards to uphold.
