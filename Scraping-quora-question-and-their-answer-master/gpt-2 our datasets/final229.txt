There is no typical day. Not for me at least. Once the honeymoon phase is over (which in my case lasted around 10 months maybe with few disruptions) then its like never ending wait for those days to come back.Let’s see.You’re waking up - feeling crumps in your belly thinking what mood he will wake up into, is he going to be mad about sth you said or do, or is he going to completely ignore his rude and distant behaviour from the previous evening.First thing he does is to check his phone, he’s on his phone all the time now, even when you’re out together ( well, its more that he takes you out, as a duty as he doesnt seem to enjoy your company anymore, so you’re eating. having a coffee/drink etc looking at him smiling to his phone (‘it’s work babes, money doesnt grow on trees you know’) - funnily enough when there are more ppl around he never seems to be bored and is not checking his phone all the time, its like only you appear completely uninteresting.He asked about your day ahead (if he’s awake or not to bothered responding to ‘work’ messages’ ) however he doesnt seem to listen to you anyway, to your talks he replies ‘yeah? ok ‘ and sometimes doesnt even takes his eyes away form his phone.He kissed you when you’re leaving home but again, its like he HAS to do that. Again, sometimes even doesnt look you in the eyes.You’re leaving thinking why he’s like that, what did you do wrong, why he doesnt value you at all… Your’re sad. Nothing seems to make you happy. It’s like a toothache. You just cant focus on anything else or think of anything else. It’s like alway at the back of your head.Sometimes you look at your colleagues getting jealous that they can be happy with planning weekends away, talking about shopping etc - you cant really participate in this cause all you can think of is what is he doing now and is he chatting this girl up you accidentally saw he was checking out on fb when you were passing by (‘its a work colleague, jesus why are you so paranoid, insecurities are not attractive besides its not normal to snoop on me all the time’ )You going to the bathroom, looking at your reflection, you can see worried face, you know you are attractive (well not a victoria secret model but still…) but all this sorrow makes you look sad and distracted. You are taking care of yourself, spending money on make up, hairdressers, beautician etc - you know you are not in 20s anymore and you want to look good for him. But whatever you do he doesnt seem to notice or be impressed.You still remember how he called you beautiful all the time, texting how he cant wait to get back home to you and showing you off to everyone. What happened that hes not like that anymore? Is it your fault? Is it because you work in the industry (both of you) where there are a lot of young women around? But your male colleagues are in happy relationships so it has to be your fault then…There are times you’d like to desperately make him jealous, but he’s not anymore. He used to be - till the point you had arguments about it. But then you found out that when he was making scenes when you were talking to a guy you know for longer then 5 minutes he was adding numerous of local women to his fb liking their half nude pics…But yeah he called you an insecure freak and told you to grow up. You had a huge argument - he stopped, well at least he said he did.But now more and more often him and his beloved phone seem to have much more fun then him and you. You know he’s deleting messages from whatsap you saw him doing it one evening. You asked him why, he got angry saying (‘well apparently i had a reason, what’s your issue again, you cant help yourself, can you? keep going and you will ruin another evening’ ) So you stopped asking, you’re just watching. Turning into a spy. You feel like its not you, you’ve never been like that.You’re coming back home, you want to be there asap as you miss him, you want to have a nice evening. But he’s on his laptop busy ‘making money’. Apartment is a mess, shopping not done (‘Im working from home, it doesnt mean I have time to go to the shop’) - shop its 3 minutes walk from your place. He often goes there to buy stuff for himself during the day forgetting about basic stuff like bread etc. or sth you may need. Too busy.Place is a mess as well, sometimes he cleans and then calling you a slob (‘I’m doing everything in here, seriously, when was last time you cleaned the floor’). You’re working full time, feeling sick and tired of cleaning after him all the time - you just basically gave up, otherwise you wouldnt be able to sit and rest. So you are a dirty one. You still remember how you spent a saturday cleaning whole kitchen and once you finished he went there to make some food and left a total mess including food on the floor. (‘you are a right freak aren’t you, I will clean it later, now i need to eat and relax’) and he completely ignored you.So yes, he’s on his laptop/phone enjoying conversations with others. Also on fb messenger chatting up with few ppl at the same time. He’s liked, always such a gentleman especially to ladies. Such a positive person they say, charming, always happy. So he’s chatting with ppl and you sat next to him feeling extremely lonely, and unwanted. Until he gives you some crumbs of attention (‘lets watch a film’) and then he plays the film and he’s still on his phone chatting and you again sat next to him not knowing what you watching thinking of how incredible lonely you are.When you ask a question he snaps at you or gives you ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer. Then he’s nice for 15 minutes and ignores you again. You feel like a needy pet. You hate yourself for that but cant help yourself blaming yourself for this (im boring, old, stupid as my opinion doesnt matter) if he ask about sth you know the best he double checks with others, as for sure you are a dumb one.He rarely texts you when you’re at work. Unless he needs sth (‘sweetie can you scan me this’) or he needs to rant about sth at his work.This month marks 3 years together. He’s going away for a business trip for 3 weeks. This makes him more amused then the anniversary. You cant help yourself thinking who is he going to meet with and what did he plan…You planned a romantic gateway when he’s back. But last night while watching this film he randomly said ‘cant believe this fucking trip will cost me at least this amount of money’ you went speechless - told him ‘we dont have to go’ but then he said ‘nah its fine, anniversary isn it’ and got back to his phone.And you just sat there staring at the wall behind the TV screen trying not to let tears go down your face.Edit:Im totally overwhelmed with the number of upvotes and comments. It gave me sort of hope, that it's not me who's causing it and I'm not loosing my mind…there are and were more of us going through this… I'm quite lonely (as many of you said, that's another ‘typical’ feeling) so if anyone of you need a chat — just feel free to message me here.Thank you for being here — all of you xEDIT: Guys— final discard happened last Friday.I'm moving out today. Please wish me luck x
