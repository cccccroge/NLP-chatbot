I'm in my last year of medical school, which consists of practical internships lasting for 1-2 months in a maternity, pediatric hospital or central hospital (Pediatrics, Obstetrics, General Surgery, Internal Medicine, Oncology, Psychiatry and Family Medicine).My day typically goes something like this:0630-0650: Coffee and breakfast, gotta start the day right0700-0830: Gym, I like to do weightlifting and a small session of HIIT cardio0900-1300: Internship, either at the hospital, maternity or pediatric hospital, depending on my schedule1300-1400: Lunch, I cook at home, typically chicken/fish/steak with carbs on the side like pasta or rice1400-2000: Sometimes I have afternoon long seminars I need to attend, but most of the time I have the afternoon to get things done: writing on my blog, working on side projects, working for a science organization I'm part of, studying/reviewing content, doing research and so on.2000-2100: Dinner, same as lunch2100-2300: More work or just relaxing, depending on how long is my todo list that dayThere are some variations - I usually go out with friends on Friday night, for example. I try not to schedule my day too much, rather organize my time around the tasks I have to complete.
