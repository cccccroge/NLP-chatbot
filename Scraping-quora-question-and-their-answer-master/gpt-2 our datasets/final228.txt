Typical?A relationship with a narcissist is about as typical as the weather with global warming. It could be 70 degrees in February or there could be a cold front in September with snow and hail.Some days were amazing! I had all of him during that golden period. I had all his attention, all his time, all his love staring at me through his adoring eyes. I felt the sweet pangs of sorrow long before we parted for the evening. Our goodbyes were long drawn out affairs.One more passionate kiss. One more loving embrace. One more stolen glance between two kids in love. A static shock between our lips. It was electric.When we weren't together I missed him in a way that was all consuming. I never felt like that before, and it's hard to imagine that it was all an act. I'm not sure how long the golden period lasted. We were together for 6 years. We were engaged 7 months before I confronted him about his behaviors, and he then packed his things and moved out. The last year he made me believe he wanted a formal relationship again, but this was simply a ploy to get fuel and revenge until he found a new primary source, and I was discarded.The first two years were filled with turbulent highs and lows. The fights were intense, but the making up was incredible. Of course, after we made up he would drop me off at my house and tell me he still wanted to take a break. I tried to hide how crushed and disappointed I was as I walked to my front door. My heart felt heavy. My soul sank. It was a familiar feeling I learned to accept like the last leaf falling before the dead of winter set in. It's inevitable, but spring always returns unless you're with a narcissist. You will have warm days again, but it will not be a budding romance like before. You will have unusually hot days in the bitter cold of winter, but it's just a tease of summer. Summer crushes always end with someone crushed. And it won't be the narcissist.The two years in the middle were equally turbulent as he bounced from job to job. But by that point I could predict his behavior and knew what not to do or say to set him off. I ignored. I denyed. I looked the other way. I supported, soothed, and encouraged. I numbed. I suppressed. Truthfully, he wasn't the only one who was acting. I was playing a role too. I was great at pretending like I was okay.Hey, hunny bunny. How was your day? Oh, I'm sorry it was terrible. You're right, your boss is an idiot. You work SO hard, and he doesn't appreciate it. But, I really don't think changing jobs is the-Well, ah…I mean if you want to change jobs you know I fully support your decision. Do you want me to make you spaghetti? Fresh warm towel when you get out of the shower? No problem. I love you. So, funny thing happened to me toda-Yeah, you're right it's not that funny. Sure, show me that video you were watching instead that's much funnier. Yeah, just leave the dishes soak in the sink. You had a hard day. I'll do them tomorrow.Could you at least take the trash out before you go up- Nevermind, I'll take it out.Cleans up. Walks upstairs. Trips over his muddy boots in the hallway. Sighs.I'm going to get a shower quick, just promise not to fall asleep.Cleans up muddy bathroom. Picks up dirty towells. Throws away the new filthy loofa my mom bought me which he used. 30 minutes later…Hun? Hey! Wake up! Can you at least move over? I know you're tired and work hard, but I've had a hard day too. First, the washing machine stopped working, and then my proff emails all these extra articles I have to read by Wednesday, and I was thinking it would be nice if we went to that museum exhibit I was telling-Snores.I crawl into bed next to this lifeless body.I whisper to myself, guess the exhibit will be coming back next year. I have a lot of work to do anyway. Probably be too tired to enjoy it.I silently cry myself to sleep while I jab him in the ribs to move over and pull the covers back from him with all my might. I try to fall asleep, but his snoring is keeping me awake.Why did he have Snapchat on his phone? Why would he use that for work? I'm probably over thinking things again.Sniffles. Whimpers. I pull the covers over my head.It's late. I should get some sleep. I have to do the dishes in the morning, and I guess I'll read all those articles for class while I wait for the repairman. I'll treat myself, and buy a new loofa after I finish everything else. Gonna' be a busy day…Yup, just your typical day with a narcissist where your love, attention, and time is all consuming. You never felt love like this before, and it's hard to imagine. You miss them before you even say goodbye. You miss them while they are right next to you. They have all of you. And you have none of them. It's when you start missing yourself that you learn it's time to say your sorrowful goodbye.Goodbye, NarcissistP.S. I love myself more!
