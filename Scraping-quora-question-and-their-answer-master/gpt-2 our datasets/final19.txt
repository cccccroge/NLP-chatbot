Being retired, I can look back at my entire working career and easily recognize a pattern. I’ve had positions with physicist as the job title at three locations, a Navy R&D lab, an Air Force lab, and at Lawrence Livermore Lab, but have also had other titles: research assistant, R&D engineer, systems test engineer, research specialist, scientific programmer/analyst, and physical scientist. The job duties naturally varied greatly, but the common thread is that one starts out doing the “grunt” work, or manual labor (if there is any), then moves up to doing more “cerebral” work (computer code writing, math development, number crunching and analysis of results), then to a semi-supervisory role of doing the technical work while at the same time guiding and helping others in similar tasks (and drafting tech reports and papers), and finally filling the shoes of a manager, either of projects or of people. For me, my last position was as an M&S project manager (Modeling & Simulation), but with the title of physical scientist, so a big part of the job was bringing in funds, followed by getting contracts setup and going, and then overseeing model development to completion, the final step being verification and validation of the model in a full simulation environment. But there will be some who will do “hands-on” work all the way to point of retirement, however they’re very much the exception to the rule. But one other important point: For probably 95% of the time on the job, your knowledge of physics and related areas does not enter in, it’s mostly “background” activities, however the other 5% is extremely important in accomplishing the task at hand. And continuing education is also very important as well, to stay abreast of rapidly advancing technology.
