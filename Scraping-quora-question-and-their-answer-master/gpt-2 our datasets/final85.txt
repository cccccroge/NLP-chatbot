It depends on person to person. When you come to BITS, there is a famous saying communicated to you. An erstwhile dean at BITS had said that, we'll give you one rope. Either you can use that to hang yourself or you could choose to climb it. So, people who want to do something in life and are very target oriented make most of their day. Which might include getting up early at around 6/7 and then attending ALL classes till 5 and using the class breaks in between very productively by studying or doing club work. Then taking some time to play sports and excerxising or engaging in club/department activities. Going to ANC becomes like a pilgrimage, every day. One where you are sure to recieve your reward. Boyfriends are daily Meera Visitors.Otherwise, there's always a lazy and unproductive path. You can sleep all day you want because of the attendance flexibility. You can play counter strike / dota / rainbow or anything probably.So, your schedule depends on who you are as a person and what other you want to pursue in the future.ReadExcerpt: If mumma was the drawing in the empty colour book, my life was, you were the crayons.Let him love you a bit more before you are not little anymore.
