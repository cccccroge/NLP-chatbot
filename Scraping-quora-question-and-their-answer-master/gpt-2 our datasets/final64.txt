The best (or worst) part of IIM-A is that there is no such thing as a typical day. This place makes sure that you cannot develop a comfort zone or a routine to do things. If you start to do so, then BAMM... two group assignment submissions and a field research project deadline in the next two days! But for the rest of it, it mostly goes like:1. Wake up in the morning at anytime between 7:30 - 8:30 depending on whether you like taking baths, or having food before classes.2. 8:45 - 1:10: Attend 3 classes of 75 mins each. Now even though the professors are some of the best you will ever encounter, and there is massive scope of learning in a non-boring way, after a while, this gets really tiring (the 20 mins break in the middle really helps in either catching up sleep, or having snacks outside if you've missed breakfast). 3. From 1:10 to 1:45 is effectively half lunchtime and half time to silently pray to god and wish that no quiz takes place. 4. If there is a quiz notice at 1:45 (they don't even spare Saturdays now!), then curse your luck and study till 2:45 when the quiz actually happens. This time though will mostly include spamming all whatsapp groups for past papers, and asking each other how much each has studied. Minimal time is given to actual preparation.5. If there isn't a quiz, take a longer lunch, go out, or sleep. The latter is what I would usually suggest so as to counter the sleeplessness which comes with a deluge of assignments and case preps. 6. Try working on some extra-curricular or recreational activities in the evening time till before dinner. Hang out with friends, eat a lot, and discuss upcoming stuff (like internships, exchange programme details, random gossip, etc.)7. Have dinner and then start preparing for the classes next day. This takes up most of the night (till maybe 2-2:30 most of the time). In between, try and arrange (the hardest task here!) a meeting with your study group so that some group assignment or submission commitments can be taken care of (if you think you know procrastination, you ain't seen nothin' yet mate!). 8. 2:00 - 2:30: Try to pass time randomlyÂ  by chatting up with more friends, listening to music and any other god damn way which is possible. Put an alarm for the next day and hope to god that your life becomes a little less hectic from tomorrow.9. Repeat.10. Ignore 9. There isn't a repeat, Every day is different!
