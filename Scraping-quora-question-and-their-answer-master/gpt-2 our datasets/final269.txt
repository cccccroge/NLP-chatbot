Assuming you know how to induce a lucid dream within 5â€“15 minutes, compared to spontaneous lucid dreams, then it will substantially affect your subjective reality.It will shatter your reality into tiny pieces and leave you disconnected from the world, physically body, personal identity, culture, religion, as you realise everything is a self or society made ideological construct.When you participate in low lucidity lucid dreaming, which most people still obsess over it will still leave you curious and confused, however nowhere near as extreme or life changing as high lucidity lucid dreaming.
