I’ve seen a lot of satirical answers on here, and some were good, but I wanted to give a more serious answer to this.I have to be at work at 7 AM. Most days. I’ll wake up at 6, or a smidge earlier, get in the shower, get dressed and ready for work, fix my lunch, and then fix breakfast to eat in my car on the way to work. Then, I drive to work and get there, hopefully, about ten minutes early.I clock in, and before our morning meeting starts, I’ll take a quick inventory of what I need to get done at work that day. I’ll try and notice what I can do that day, and what I will need to wait until a later day. Some things are more important than others.I’ll work a couple of hours, and then around 9, I’ll take my first break. I’ll try and snack a bit and hang out with my work buddy in the break room before I had back to work.After break, I usually work about 3 to 4 hours straight. Around 1 or so, I’ll take my second break, and I’ll eat what I’ve brought for lunch. It’s usually a can of soup, chili, or some leftovers. Nothing fancy. After that, I’ll work another hour, and then take my actual lunch break around 2. If I have errands to run, this is usually when I will take care of them. I have an hour for lunch, so, if anything needs to be done, this is the best time.I’ll come back to work around 3, finish up anything last minute that needs to be done, then a few minutes before I leave work, usually a little after 4, I’ll clean up my area, and put everything back where it belongs.After work, on a normal day, I’ll drive home, and be home by 4:30. If my wife isn’t busy, she’ll cook supper. If she is, I’ll cook it. She cooks about half the time, and I will cook the other time.After we eat, I’ll try and spend some time with my daughter and wife. We’ll do different things depending on the weather. Some times, we’ll go for a walk, others, we’ll go the park, and some days, just play in the yard or the trampoline.During the evening. my wife will usually give our daughter a bath. During this time, I’ll watch some TV or play some video games. When they are finished with my daughter’s bath, she’ll bring her to me, and I’ll clothe her, dry her hair, and put on her jammy jams. It’s usually after 8 by the time this happens. We’ll finish up everything we need to do for the next day, and usually settle down for the night a little after 9. We try to be in bed by 9:30, and asleep by ten. Then, we rest for the night and start over the next day.Nothing too fancy. But I think I live a blessed life. Our house is modest. Our vehicles aren’t flashy. Our clothes don’t scream swag.But, I left out a few things I’ll add now.I’m 40. My first job at 15 was walking a mile to a guy’s house and feeding his dogs twice a week. I got $25 dollars a month for this.When I was 16, I worked on a farm from 5 in the morning, until 7 or 8 at night. I made $4.35 per hour for this job in 1993, and thought I was rich.I was fortunate enough to go to college, but poor enough of a student not to do well, and unfortunately, have no degree. I do physical labor, and have for the past 25 years of my life. I don’t make a ton of money, but I don’t spend more than I have, usually, and try and pay things off as quickly as possible. Sometimes, I do without.Again, I’m 40. When I wake up in the morning, my back is sometimes sore. It takes a few minutes and a shower for it to ease up.When I drive to work, I do so on a pretty bad, patched up county road.I eat cheap meals, leftovers, and we cook at home a lot more than we eat out.I have three or four pair of good pants, a few polos, and a few button ups. That’s my wardrobe.Until recently, I drove a twenty year old beater car, that didn’t have an air conditioner, and only an AM/FM radio.I have a facebook, instagram, quora, and twitter account. On the last one, despite trying to avoid it, I typically see political posts telling me how people who think and act like me are horrible.I work 8+ hours a day, and wonder how different my life would be better if I didn’t have to work 2–4 hours per day for someone else, or to pay for something I’ll never get to use. Or, it goes to a politician who has more things than I’ll ever see, but thinks I’m deplorable, or a racist, or evil and greedy. (I didn’t vote for Trump, btw.)I could spend that time better with my family, or that money better on paying my mortgage off sooner.But, I’m told, constantly, that if I think like that, I’m horrible and don’t care about other people.I do care about other people. More than myself most of the time. They just live in the same house as me.
