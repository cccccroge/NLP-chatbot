Wakeup and check email from secret society imposing a liberal agenda that includes fake news for the upcoming week and fake data on climate change. Disseminate this information to my communist friends and commit to the conspiracy talking points. No time to lose I'll use the bathroom later shower etc maybe twice a week anyways…I meditate after this as well on ways to destroy the fabric of society and weaken family values with liberal ideals, check Jim Carey's twitter and maybe George Clooney or Leonardo DiCaprio s for inspiration. I pace for about an hour or two before a vegan brunch seething at the fact that conservatives are always right with their seamless logic, all while refusing to ever admit this to anyone publicly. I don't work because I get money from the liberal agenda society for supporting their cause on the internet by spreading propaganda on Facebook and Twitter or by replying in the comment sections of conservative media like FOX News. I spend the afternoon sharpening my rhetoric skills...It’s really tough arguing with conservatives and I feel I just have to get better at pretending to actually care about real people, but the argument needs to be crafted in a way that you don't project an agenda and that you really can just think for yourself. Of course I can't and that's what makes it all so exhausting. But the cheques that come in the mail for supporting the liberal agenda makc it all worthwhile. It's an extremely lucrative lifestyle. I'm so libtarded but hey it's a living.
