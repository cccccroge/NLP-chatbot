I get out of bed with a leap and a spry step. Im a morning person, Ill let you groan while im whistling and flicking on lights, yanking back curtains, and opening blinds.Then I get the coffee started, and wake up my son. I get his breakfast around while he drags himself through the living room and onto the couch. He's his mothers son when it comes to mornings.Breakfast made, I check my email, sip some coffee, flick on the news, which Ill 90% ignore, and then get my boy in the shower. While he is de-scumming I get his clothes laid out, choosing something ridiculous. While he gets dressed I throw on some ragged clothes to see him off on the bus. Then I get cleaned up, get my gear together, and take off for work myself.I fucking love mornings!
