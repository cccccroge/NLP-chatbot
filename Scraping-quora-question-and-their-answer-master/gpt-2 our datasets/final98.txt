A Day in the Life of a Hedge Fund ManagerI was asked by someone ‘how do you find the time’? I have been asked this since I was 12 when I learnt assembly language on my TRS80, investing in privatisation stocks like BT with my grandmother’s savings!So here is a day in the life of a hedge fund manager. No two days are the same however.PART10700: I hate getting up early, unless jet lagged or doing the BBC in which case I am up at 0350. No, I’m no superhero. I usually get up whatever time my wife does, so I can drive her to the station0720: Check the financial news. I would normally have slept at 0100-0300 so I won’t have missed much news. My go to places are my Bloomberg app and my FT app. I also like Flipboard so I can keep up to date on private equity and hedge fund news and algorithmic trading as well as entrepreneur news. I also look at www.pipspredatordaily.com as it gives me a great summary of exactly the news on the markets I want to see. I will also check any alerts I’ve received from my team on WhatApp. Usually there are none. I will also have a quick look at the market rates and charts to see how the markets are moving in usually the major and minor currencies and indices, but more recently in gold and oil too because we’ve had some profitable trades there. I don’t like staring at the screens all day long, it is not needed, and leads to reacting not responding to the market.0730: Get ready. I am lucky, as my own boss I don’t need to wear a suit and tie. So getting ready is usually quick. I prefer wearing my gym gear so I have less of an excuse. If I have meetings, then I have a suit ready at the office and will get changed there.0735: shower, shave etc with BBC Radio 4 playing in the background for the political news from the Today Programme. Quick check of emails in case anything I need to deal with. I have 3 personal assistants, one my Government work, one for media and events and one for everything else. This means I don’t usually have many emails I have to handle personally.0800: Smoothie – made by my wife, lovingly, unless she’s too busy. Then I drive her to the station and head to my desk. (I can make calls from my car handsfree to the trading team to make sure all is running fine and what I need to do today).0820: At my desk. I will open up the market screens. I have a huge monitor over my shoulder so I am not distracted and can turn around and look at it when I am curious. You look at Facebook, I look at the market. My team based on my instructions and my algorithms will have selected some trades and will either ask my view what I want to go with, or will have done it if I am not around. Today they are buying USD/JPY and GBP/AUD. What they trade depends on rules which are part of their training and like many firms what we also give our apprentices so they can learn too.0840: I am brand ambassador for 24option and the Head of Marketing just messaged on WhatsApp about catching up so I juggle a few things around. My phone is my desk. I love what they are trying to achieve with customer service and it took a while for them to convince me they were serious. Indeed they found me through Bloomberg and that was the clincher that they were indeed serious to be the best for customers. I want to help them get there. I am a business man and appreciate businesses trying to innovate. I like writing trading educational material for 24option who just won an award for their education so am happy to put my thoughts and insights into an email for them.0845: I reply to some of my apprentices on a couple of questions they have. I usually have only 1 or 2 emails because most of the mentoring issues are answered through the training material I created.I absolutely love being in touch with private investors because they were the people I wrote for in my weekly Financial Times column (‘Diary of an Internet Trader’) before I had my own fund. They were the people my books were addressed for.PART20900: I have a quick call with a Government official. Over a decade ago the British Government noticing my stock picking abilities in the Financial Times, asked me to pick the best technologies for the UK Government to bring to Britain. I am responsible for Asia and like focusing on Fintech because it’s my area of speciality.0930: Another quick call and an eye on the market. This call is with a great Fintech company working with the UN. I really love companies doing social good. They are working on Blockchain and given my interest in Crypto - thanks to 24option - I like to know the insider views on this tech.1000: Emails to our bankers. Our funds are domiciled in Luxembourg and we have Rothschilds as our bankers and they usually have something or other I need to sign because we have 3 funds and the compliance requirements are very onerous.1010: Email our compliance team. I usually have one or two emails a day around compliance as the FCA regulatory burden gets heavier. We have a team who ensure all our documents are up to date. And also we have to keep informed about the latest regulatory best practices so bulletins are a must.1030: As brand ambassador for 24option I want to get some trades done through their MT4 forex platform, so am just getting our trading algorithms set up. I am really excited about this relationship. They are so keen to listen to customers and also offer FX trading and CFDs so I want to see if we can make them the best for customer service in the world in their field.1130: Emails from our auditors, Ernst and Young. Again, we have some forms I need to sign. This is not daily, but unusual to have both.1145: Liaise with my PAs on when I can fit in BBC paper review in the next fortnight. I reach an audience of 75m worldwide and the BBC is such an amazing brand. It’s great to have such a profile when you are in business and I love speaking my mind. But because I travel so much, I have to plan carefully my appearances.1200: Barclays Bank are in touch. They want me to be a keynote speaker at a new professional network they are launching and need a biog and pics.1210: Investec would like to do a video interview with me and my views on the markets so I am trying to fit them in at some point between travels. This has been on the books for 3 months now and I have just been travelling too much - India, Hong Kong, Singapore Malaysia and just not fitted it in!1215: I am just checking the news on stocks showing ‘profit warning’. I am looking at algorithms based on newsflow which can immediately ‘short stocks’ as soon as such announcements are made. We are working on this. I love working on trading developments. We want to be an innovative fund but also an innovative trading software company.1230: A call with a partner on our new automated trading tech algorithms. I want to have more backup systems in place, and am sorting legal contracts on intellectual property so this takes a bit of time. We look at the markets together. I used to sit in front of a computer all day, then realised that is not a good way to trade, or indeed necessary. You don’t buy a dog then do the barking yourself. So I still like looking at screens, even though trades are in place and it would be inefficient to place more today. We talk about optimisation and efficiencies. We need to invest in more servers!Part 31300: I’ve been busy with my accountants and lawyers making sure the brokers have the company information they need. I want my automated trading strategies to be offered to the public.1415: A quick Skype call with Australia and Greece to discuss (very late for Oz) some trading account and algo issues – nothing major.1430: Late lunch. I try to eat healthy. But it’s usually at my desk and certainly not mindful eating. During lunch I tap out an article on trades I have open at the moment. My followers love reading about these and with my new brand ambassadorship with 24option.com means I have an added reason to share this.1530: I check on the trading performance so far today. I use 10 different brokers, not just 24option to compare market performance. The reason for doing this is so I have access to multiple routes to liquidity to ensure no one broker has too much control over what I want to do. I usually have 2-3 positions open max in a day. What most people do not realise about trading is that more positions does not mean more money.1630: Quick nap…I confess. Tired. I hate this time of the day!1700: A change in protocols for dealing with our customers using my trading algorithms. Once of my apprentices complained that one of our technicians had not called him and neither had one of my PAs. This really annoyed me and I have put together new customer service protocols to deal with this so it never happens again. Maybe it is my legal training but I can be precise, rule based and strategic and very quick at it. Being a barrister is the best training for being a businessman.1730: I return a quick call to one of my Government related work companies which I am helping on their strategy for global expansion. They are in Cybersecurity and I love working with entrepreneurs.1745: I have a bunch of admin things to do. My accountants are based in UK, but bookeepers in India, and they needed a few questions answered.1800: I have to prepare for my webinar at 1900. I like to do webinars to keep in touch with private investors. It feeds into what I am trying to do with technology. You can watch my webinars free on www.alpeshpatel.com – I want to include some new slides to deal with the issues people are facing. I love teaching, but I also learn losts too when I do this.1900-2130: I do my webinar. It takes a lot out of me because I put so much passion into teaching online trading and I always stay online until every question is answered.2200: Home – later than normal – but it’s been a good day to diary. My wife is understanding.0000: In bed. I will have the trading report of the day’s trading from our algorithms in the markets. The report takes a minute to read and I just check the day’s trades, which currencies and the P & L to make sure there was nothing unusual. Quick check of emails.Alpesh PatelAlpesh B Patel (@alpeshbp https://www.linkedin.com/in/alpe... )
