My colleagues all had excellent answers. As a male in a gender identified profession, I often heard "Oh, you're only a nurse. Why didn't you go to Med school?" Most of us choose to be a RN, but my experience is that few are meant to be RNs. I say that because many today go to nursing school with the sole intention of becoming either an administrator or a nurse practitioner. A few go on to teach formally in an academic setting. As this trend continues, it leaves few smart, qualified clinical nurses or "floor nurses".Here are in my opinion, talents that every clinical nurse must possess. First and formost great clinical skills. We are the front line, when a patient goes "bad". If you don't recognize signs that a patient may be in trouble right away, it may be too late.We must be facilitators, coordinating care between doctors, and various departments in the clinical setting.Good documentation is a must. Sadly, this is not often the case. Doctors often do not read nurses notes if all they say is "patient is resting quietly"Teachers, many people are not aware the amount of teaching a nurse does. First and foremost, is patient and family education. If a patient and their family does not understand what they need to do, or its importance, they will usually not comply. We also teach less experienced nurses. I can't count the number of times when nursing students were met by groans from the staff when they came on a floor. We even teach young interns and residents, although no one will admit that.Counselors, we must always remember that patients are frightened and feel they have no control while under our care, I was recently on the other side as a patient. I became very aware of how many nurses and other staff failed to even acknowledge me as the provided some care to me. We need to continually reassure the patient, and his family that we are doing our best to help them. No matter how technically skilled we are means nothing if we don't provide the "human touch".It takes a special person to be a good nurse. If you don't want to get your hands dirty(and make sure you wash them well), work long hours, and deal with sick people, who may not be very pleasant because they are sick, then please choose another profession. I am now retired. Some days I miss it. I wouldn't have traded one moment.
