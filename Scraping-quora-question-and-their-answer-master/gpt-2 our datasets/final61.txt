Here’s a typical day for the Vice President of the United States:Leave the VP residence early in the morning to go to the White House.Arriving at the White House, find the president and check his pulse.Check the calendar and see if there are any funerals of world leaders to go to.Check in with the Senate and see if any ties need to be broken.Stop in one more time and check the president’s pulse.Go home.That’s about it.
