I’m an professional engineer and consultant so I work with people who want to build a building / cell tower / data center or whatever.I spend most of my time doodling on paper or on the computer.The doodles are the result of many conversations with the client and other engineering type people.We then take all of our collective doodles and hand them off to a construction crew.Much stronger larger men and women then take those and create things in real life.Watching what I drew turn into real stuff really excites me.Sometime I go check the construction to make sure they understood my doodles. I feel funny with a construction hat on. Sometimes I didn’t draw enough stuff on the paper. Sometimes what one symbol means to me means something different to them.Occasionally I even contradict myself. One doodle says one thing but a different doodle says a to do something different. Then the shit really hits the fan.
