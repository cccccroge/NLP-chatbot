Thanks for A2A!In my case you can sum it up like that:Write code, produce plots, look at plots, write more code, look at more plots, show plots to people who know more than you and so on...That might be true for most of the physicists doing data analysis for the experiments.Most of my days look just as I described above. Experiments usually produce tons of data (terabytes per day being precise). In order to extract any useful information you need to prepare some clever ways of choosing proper events and then even cleverer way of showing crucial stuff, hence - plotting, plotting, plotting.Another important part of the day is consulting with experts. There is an extensive email exchange, plus we usually have couple of video conferences per week, to show progress, assess quality of obtained results, discuss next steps etc.And of course I browse Quora a lot, when waiting for my program to execute and calculate everything - just like now ;)
