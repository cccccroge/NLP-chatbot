My mom and dad (divorced for many years) have very different lifestyles.My dad who is turning 84 in August lives in a retirement centre (not a home) where his meals are all provided for him. He generally gets up very early as in 5am (but is in bed by 7 - 8pm every night) as he always got up early for work all of his life and has never been one to sleep in. On days his arthritis isn’t bad he’ll go for a walk or stay in his room and read until breakfast at 7am. He reads and watches TV a lot but will go to the communal room to visit with the other people living there or walk to the Seniors Community Centre a few times a week to play cards. In addition as he still drives he’ll offer to take some of the other residents to WalMart or out on other errands. As my brother lives only a few minutes walk away he’ll also go there a few times a week for dinner.My mom, who just turned 80 is much more active. She generally gets up around 8 am (but stays up late to watch the 11 pm news on TV) and makes breakfast for herself and long time boyfriend who lives next door. On weekends they will go out to yard sales or flea markets and through the week she’ll drive Cancer patients (although she just decided to give that up as she felt the wear and tear on her car was getting to be too much) and she’s also very active with Eastern Star (a female branch of The Mason’s) and goes to weekly meetings plus in very active in putting on many of their charity events. She also sings at events and still has her sailboat which she loves to sail in the summer months plus as she lives rural and on the water will maintain her property (has a riding lawn mower). She’s busier than I am! I’ve noticed she has slowed down a bit in the past year but she’s still going strong and I pray she continues to do so for many years!
