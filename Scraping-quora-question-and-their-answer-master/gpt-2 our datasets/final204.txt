My office do not have any specific timing, I can go at any time and leave anytime but in general I go at around 10.30-11.00 AM and return by 5.30-6.30 AM (Included travel time)2. I have average and relaxed work pressure, some times I work from home also, on an average I work 5-6 hours per day. I often take work to my home and like to finish them in the late night since in office I find it difficult to concentrate completely on work.3. I work from home when I have too much work or don't have any work. In first case I wake up by 9.30 AM and complete breakfast and other things by 10.15 AM, 15 mins for Facebook, Quora, News, Whatsapp, then start working from 10.30 AM, 1 PM-2.30 PM lunch and small nap, from 2.30 PM I again start working and work until it requires. If I have no work that day, I simply sleep and watch movies, surf the net while staying online on office messenger for any help my colleagues may seek.4. Depending on work pressure, meetings etc my routine may vary, one thing is that I can have meeting at any time between 6 AM- 2 AM, since most of the people I work with are in different time zones.5. If I do not have any serious work I halt everything whenever a new TV series episode comes or if something interesting happens in Sports or News and watch it first.6. I always have Quora and Whatsapp (and sometimes Facebook also) opened in my browser. I have a habit that I cant tolerate any pending notification, message etc. So whenever I get any message, mail, notification I must read it. I remain available almost all the time I am awake.7. I have noticed that I spend most of the time on Quora than my work. At office during my work also I read Quora side by side, may be not so actively.8. I have actually taken the 24 hour day as per choice. My day starts at 9.30 AM instead of typical 6.30/7.30 AM and ends at 3.30/4 AM instead of typical 11.30/12.30 PM. I do not have any particular time frame for work. I work whenever I feel comfortable through out the day. That's why I shared my 24 hour full schedule. Of course I follow deadlines too. 8. Weekends : I rarely work on weekends. On weekends I generally sleep till 11.30 AM-12.00, hangout with friends, watch movies or tv series. My activity on Quora, Whatsapp, Facebook and on internet increases at least by 3-4 hour on weekends.
