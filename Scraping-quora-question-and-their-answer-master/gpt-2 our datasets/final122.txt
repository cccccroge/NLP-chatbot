Well, it really depends on where you live, as well as other factors like your socioeconomic status, gender, race, condition of health, etc. Let’s take three well-known liberals whom are also youtubers; Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks, Kyle Kulinski of Secular Talk and Hank Green from Nerdfighteria. These three liberals have widely divergent typical days.Hank Green’s typical day involves living with a chronic disease. But he’s well-off enough to afford his medications and treatment. He’s also the leader of his own businesses, so he’s not inconvenienced as much by his condition. Contrast that with your average liberal American who most likely has to work a job on a fixed income, who might not be able to afford the $600 a month for medication after Warner-Chilcott hiked the prices back in 2011.Then there’s Cenk Uygur. In addition to being a liberal, he’s also a first-generation immigrant and a visible minority. So in addition to getting a lot of flak about having liberal views, he also gets a lot of flak about his race/ nationality which I doubt that Hank Green ever gets.Then there’s Kyle Kulinski. He probably fares better than both Hank and Cenk. Although he’s probably not as well off as Hank or Cenk, he also happens to be a white, US-born American who is also in great health. Yet he shares roughly the same liberal views as Hank and Cenk.So there you have it. I gave three examples of liberals who have widely divergent typical days. But it can get even more divergent than this. Most liberals are not celebrities. Like these three, a lot of liberals also don’t live in liberal bubbles (like Los Angeles, Missoula and New York City) where they can easily find communities of like-minded people. Most liberals aren’t even American and might even live in different countries where liberalism might be even more prevalent, or where liberal ideas might be extremely unpopular. There’s truly diversity among liberals.Well, I guess that I should also give an example of my typical day. Well I’m not American. I don’t live in a liberal bubble. Finding people with similar beliefs is TOUGH where I am. Just mere months ago, I worked at a job with people of 3 different nationalities, all of whom ridiculed me on a regular basis for my social and political views. My supervisor at work, never let me live down that day when I told him my views on restorative justice and rehabilitating criminals. But here at my new job, my new supervisor is more likely to agree with such views. The same goes for my views on a whole lot of other things that used to get me ridiculed. But still, I live in a society where liberalism is not mainstream and where progressive discussions usually take place behind closed doors. I’ve lived in liberal bubbles on two other occasions in my life. I wasn’t as liberal as I am today when I lived in those places though. I hated the first bubble I lived in and still would not ever want to live there again even though my beliefs have changed (no thanks to their regressive bogus arguments). The second “liberal bubble” I lived in, wasn’t as bad. Although left-leaning, you had some diversity of belief and people were willing to listen to you and debate or inform you if your views deviated from theirs. They definitely did a better job of bringing me father to the left (than I previously was) than that other place did. Even after I moved away, I still continued drifting further left as I learned more. If I still lived in either one of these liberal bubbles, my typical day as a leftist would be different than it is right now.So there you have it. It really depends on a lot of factors what a liberal’s typical day is like. At the end of the day, we’re all just people living a diverse set of lifestyles. Anyone can be a liberal and we all have different typical days.
