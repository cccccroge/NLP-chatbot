Physicists of course do many things in their work, they have to arrange meetings, they go to conferences, many are at universities and teach, but in terms of physics there are two main types of focus, theory/modeling or experimentation.The experimenters are always:Preparing a plan for an experimentExecuting an experimentAnalyzing the data from an experimentsThe theorists are always:Making models to explain previous experimental dataUsing their models to predict possible new experimental data to confirm/deny their models.And of course, there is a little bit of theorist and experimentalist in all physicists, yet in practice a given project will involve a collaboration between theorists with the model and math work and experimentalists to execute on the idea.
