Depends on the engineer. Some interface with clients and have lots of phone calls and meetings. Others stay at their desks or workstations all day, making calculations, writing computer software, etc. Still others work in a lab testing equipment and tweaking prototypes. Yet others are in the regulatory arena and gather data and write white papers on public policy issues. Some teach.
