In my undergrad, I used to wake up at 6:30 to catch my college bus which reached my stop at 7. So waking up early was not too difficult (until IIMA happened.)I must mention that no two IIM students will have the same schedule, and no two days will be the same for the average person. Apart from this, my schedule is, in relation to the rest of my batch, bizarre, to say the least.Â The majority of students prefer to grab breakfast before the classes, so they wake up by 8:10. I, however, have no faith in breakfast, and value sleep more; thus, I rarely stir before 8:15.At 8:20, after having silenced an alarm every five minutes from 7:30, I'm woken up by the loud thumping on my room door by a very kindly and responsible dormmate. With great reluctance, I sleepily pack the day's case material, freshen up and head for class, to reach by 8:45 (lateness is a bad idea for any student at WIMWI.)Since my room is on the ground floor and very close to the classroom, a brisk walk will take me to class in just under a minute. (I don't run unless a rabid dog is chasing me.)We have 75 minute classes with 20 minute breaks in between.If class is boring, I fight sleep (with varying degrees of success.)Else, I stay awake with no effort. (The classes loaded with witticisms from profs never fail to hold my attention.)If I'm awake and prepared (not always the case), I put CP points every now and then. (Their relevancy to the case is often debatable.)If I'm awake and unprepared (as is often the case) I try to get last-minute case gyaan from a sidey before the class begins.If the sidey is prepared, I hope those points will help and try to put CP every now and then.If the sidey is unprepared, I pray that the prof doesn't feel like ripping me a new one.(When you are afraid to be cold-called due to lack of preparation, your cold-call probability shoots up to nearly 100%. I call this the cold-call principle.)(Note: I did manage to sleep, with no immediate consequences, through a whole term of financial markets taught by a highly knowledgeable prof, and I still regret this decision.)In the break, I wash my face in a half-assed attempt to lose my sleepiness.I go downstairs to have a cup of tea and bask in the sunshine. I return to class by 10:20.Repeat class storyline.At 11:35, run out of class for another cup of tea and some sunlight.Return by 11:55 to the class storyline.Now, for the lunch-eaters, the destination is the mess (or one of the various eateries scattered around campus; some have the lunch delivered to their rooms.)At 1:15 PM, I amble into my room after spending a few minutes chatting with people outside the academic block.In case of a quiz announced some days earlier, I delude myself into thinking I'm studying, while really staring blankly at old question papers and imagining how life will be without these depressing quizzes.In case there hasn't been any announcement made yet, I wait patiently till 1:50 (the notification arrives at 1:45, but can often be delayed by up to 5 minutes.)If I get a notification and it's a difficult subject, I curse the day I was born, my decision to do an MBA and so on, then grouchily study for the quiz (see first sentence of paragraph for description.)If it's an easy subject, I shrug and grab 30 minutes of sleep. Post this, I wake up and brush through the case material to identify what topics we covered (I should know what topics I can write globe about, after all!) and leave for the classroom.If there was no notification, I bless the PGP office for its benevolence, and catch up on my sleep.Since I'm no know-it-all, I see no need for every minute of the quiz. I usually stroll into the room at 2:45, just as everyone has frantically started scribbling on the paper. Last in, first out. The next 45-odd minutes are spent wondering whether I should just hand in the quiz or make a feeble attempt at answering some question I don't trust myself to understand.Now the storylines converge again. Between 3:30 and 4:00 PM, I'm either somewhat rested ("no quiz" effect) or somewhat worn out (quiz effect). I have a relaxed and heavy lunch, spend some time online, or watch a movie. (My studying only begins after dark, if at all.)Finally, it's dark. The time is now 8 PM.If I have an incomplete assignment due in two days or less, I start (or continue) working on it. This usually lasts till 4 AM, or completion - whichever is earlier. Completed assignments are submitted as soon as possible after completion.If no assignments, I start the next day's case/reading (depending on the subject)If I smell success, I stick with it like a dog to a bone, until I've reached a fair level of understanding. Quite often, this doesn't happen, so I find myself looking for help. This exercise usually lasts ten minutes - if I find no one else able/willing to help, I decide "The hell with it", visit the music room, play the drums for a while and get back to my room by midnight. (Dinner is usually between 9 and 11 PM)Then it's an hour or two of casual textbook/case reading (in a last-ditch attempt to make sense of, or at least blindly memorize the case facts) and then fall asleep any time between 3-6 AM. Sometimes I walk down to the cafe near my dorm for a cup of tea (and/or some Maggi) between 3-4 AM.------------------------------------During exams, however, this is quite different. We normally have one exam starting at 9:30 AM and another at 2:30 PM.These days for me begin at 9:15 AM. I wake up, hurriedly try to recall what I'd read the previous night in a half-asleep state of mind, and pack my stationery and a calculator (if needed). After the first exam, I return to my room. If the next exam is an easy subject, I sleep till 2 PM, revise the keywords (yes, you read it right) and strut in at 2:30. If it's a hard subject, I struggle to prepare; the stress makes me sleepy and I doze off until 1:30, waking up and attempting some last-minute cramming.I return from the exam typically between 4:30 and 5:30; if I have no exam the next day (thus having the rest of the week off) I set a playlist of 4-5 movies, order some junk food to my room, and live decadently for the rest of the week. If there is an exam the next day, I sleep till 8 PM.After the nap, I pack some books and head to the library. The rest of my night will be spent there, desperately mugging concept after incomprehensible concept. Between 5-7 AM, I give up this pretense and return to my room for a couple of hours of shut-eye. (Rest is important for the human body, no?)------------------------------------Club activities: Being a member of only the music club, I have the benefit of lots of free time (as opposed to the blessed souls who are in a gazillion clubs at once.) Since we in the music club do not have daily activities, my work with the club happens in bursts, which are quite fun (impromptu jam sessions till 2 or 3 AM, practice sessions up to a week before some event, etc.) and typically happen once every three months.------------------------------------Disclaimer: I understand this would come off as dangerously casual to anyone familiar with the rigour of IIM-A. And that reaction would be quite appropriate. My sincere advice to any aspiring WIMWIan reading this is "These stunts are performed by an overconfident guy under unsupervised conditions. Please do not try them yourselves, whether at IIM-A or at any other b-school."
