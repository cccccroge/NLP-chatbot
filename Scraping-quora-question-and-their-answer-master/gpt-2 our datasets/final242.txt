I recently had a houseguest who was a childhood friend. The friend turned out to be a narcissist. She fit every identifying trait and it was the hardest time I’ve ever had.This woman was completely self absorbed and demanded that I be focussed on her only. She was in a hotel room with another friend and myself and we were preparing to leave so my other friend and myself got on our phones to let our families know we were about to hit the road for what was going to be a 4 hour trip. She stood between us and with the bitterest voice said WELL!! I NEVER THOUGHT I’D BE WITH PEOPLE WHO WOULD IGNORE ME TO PLAY ON THEIR PHONES. We were both shocked, and me being me determined I’d stay on my phone for a little longer. Every word out of her mouth was either a complaint or a criticism and when she finally left I was emotionally drained. It has been only 4 days and I feel like I have PTSD. I need to find help dealing with the after math of this horrible experience.
