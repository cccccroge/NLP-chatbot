Get up at 9:00 AM.  Eat oatmeal, read newspaper.  Answer email and kick around ideas until I'm hungry again.  Eat light lunch.  Be amazingly productive at the keyboard from 1 - 3.  Nap from 3 to 3:30.  Be amazingly productive from 4 - 6.  (Except on Thursdays when I go see my mom in her retirement home.)  Eat dinner with my fabulous wife.  Reboot brain by hanging out with fabulous wife or other visitors, often just watching Netflix or recorded TV from 7 - 10:30.  Be amazingly productive from 11 PM - 1 AM.  Repeat Monday - Friday.  But that's just me.  You'll have to figure out the most productive rhythms for your own life.  To be honest, out of 250 weekdays in a year, the above fantasy schedule only occurs about a 125 times.  Oh yeah, deadlines -- self-imposed or based on client and publisher demands -- greatly increases motivation.  jaypayleitner.com
