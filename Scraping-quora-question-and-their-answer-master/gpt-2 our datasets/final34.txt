Well, I work on a short term rehab floor. I have 20 patients. When I first come in at 3pm, I do rounds, make sure everyone is okay, check that narcotic pain patches are in place. Then I count narcotics and get report from the day shift nurse. Then, I'll go around giving 4 and 5 pm medications and do 4pm blood sugar checks, giving insulin if need be. Some of my residents have g-tubes, so I'll give medication through there. Some of my more critical patients I'll do a quick assessment of otherwise they are just a quick "Hi" and that's it. I don't have enough time in my shift to really give the patients the time they might need or what I might want to give. At 530pm, I'm done with the early med pass. I usually try to eat at this time if it's not too busy. (frequently it is)At 6 pm, I start giving out medications for 6 and 7pm. Once I'm done around 730, I'll check the treatment book and start jotting down what treatments I'll have to do (wound care, foley care, various creams and bandages, heel boots)At 8pm I'll go around again doing 9pm meds and blood sugars, doing treatments as I go along. At 10pm I'm generally done and I'll start charting on all the residents that are "on report." On a good day I'll leave at 11-1130pm. On a bad day- because let's face it, I work in rehab- people fall, people get critically ill, they are actively dying, we get several, several admissions per week so I have to somehow find time to admit two or three people during my shift- a LOT of extra work. I just happened to highlight a "quiet" night. It's sometimes absolutely overwhelming the amount of work that is expected of you during one day and it makes you question your sanity for staying with it, really. You come home mentally and physically exhausted but if you think of the good things - a stage IV ulcer healing, someone walking again, the thank yous from residents and the appreciation and love from them and their families- it's worth all the insanity.
