There really is no typical day for Elon. My biggest takeaway from doing the book was that Elon starts out most days looking to address the "critical path" blocking any one of his companies from achieving their goals. Basically, he tries to find the major problem and then do what he can to help fix it. Sometimes this means Elon will personally try and solve the problem. Other times, it means he'll give a team more money and more people instantly to try and finish a project quickly. I'm in awe of his ability to deal with these problems so effectively and to get so much out of his employees. That said, this approach also helps explain some of the herky-jerky nature you see at both SpaceX and Tesla. The company goes all in trying to get a new rocket or new car feature out, accomplishes its task and then heads onto to the next big thing. It makes things feel very spiky rather than smooth and points to why the companies are often late with products.
