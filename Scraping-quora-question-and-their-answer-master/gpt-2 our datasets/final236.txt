“A typical day with a narcissist” - an essay in three parts.Before the day starts - dawn hasn’t even started and your eyes are wide open, your brains on maximum capacity, worried about work, tasks, household chores, bills to pay, taxes to declare, kids to take to school, pets to be carried to the vet. The narc? Sleeping like a baby, after all, (s)he has a slave to care about all the daily demands!During the day - you try your best to handle all those responsabilities listed above, but the narcissist is always creeping into your day putting you down and calling you unexpectedly as if tailing your every step. Nothing you do is good enough for the narcissist, (s)he always though/expected/wanted you to have done something else or the same, only better. You cannot win a single argument and you will not receive a single ‘thank you’ for any time you went out of your way to please the narcissist.… and then falls the darkness - night has come and after all you’ve done, you still has a narcissist to serve. You will be expected to attend to the narcissist’s every need and comply to all his/her desires, regardless of how physically tired you are, your weary state of mind, your own values and dignity. The narcissist will overstep any boundaries, behave entitled to all your possessions and treat you like an extention of his/her own self. All abuse will always happen behind close doors. You are not safe.Just in case I haven’t outlined the main idea enough: this life is not worth living. Don’t fight back. Escape. Run. Never look back. Best of luck to you!
