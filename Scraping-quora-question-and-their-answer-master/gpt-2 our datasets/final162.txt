My mother is quite elderly (90â€™s) and she is very active. In fact she is a central figure in her community which is a small rural village.As a Justice of the Peace (JP) in her community she is often consulted to write official letters, give advice, sign documents and other official matters.As a past school Principal and an elder in the community she is consulted for letters of recommendation. She keeps a small library at the side of her patio and kids from the community can freely use the booksShe does gardening, using a hired help to assist with the heavy duty aspects. In fact she pots and sells plants on a small scale. Because her house is on the main road passing travelers stop and purchase plants from time to time.She is very involved in community projects - at church, at the community centre, at the botanical gardens. Her role is usually being part of the planning and evaluation and sometimes oversight.She is a subscriber to multiple senior citizens groups and as a result she is often taking trips with one group or another. A few weeks ago the retired teachers group organized a 3-day tour of the island and of course she took part.So her day is not made up of a consistent set of activities.Rather she engages in a number of activities which she executes as they arise.She reads the newspaper daily. She is happy and content.
