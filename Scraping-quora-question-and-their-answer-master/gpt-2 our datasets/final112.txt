My alarm goes off early in the morning, the glorious Soviet anthem jolting me out of my wonderful dream about taking all the money from big corporations and giving it to that homeless guy who hangs out across the street. I get out of bed, pausing to throw a reverent look towards the portrait of Lenin on the wallFor breakfast, I have some all-inclusive, gluten-free, vegan, equal-opportunity, etc. Cheerio- um, I mean generic, non-branded, donut-shaped cereal that has nothing to do with trademarked symbols of bourgeoisie corporate oppression. I put on a Che Guevara t-shirt and some sweatpants, and hunt around for my black hoodie and bandana for the antifa rally after school.I don’t actually attend any classes, because the teachers just repeat sexist, bigoted propaganda, then get mad at me when I tell them. I can’t believe how rude they are!!!!1!1!!!11!!!!1111!!!!! I just find an empty hallway and smoke pot all day. I’m technically failing all my classes, but grades are just a letter. I identify as trans-grade. It’s so transphobic of you to assume that I’m a F just because that’s what’s on my report card. Inside, I’m an A+!After school, I get on the train. I don’t pay for my ticket, because I don’t support the misogynist government organizations. At this point, you might point out that refusing to pay money to government-run utilities like public transportation contradicts my aforementioned socialist positions, thus making me somewhat hypocritical. To which I would reply, OMG THAT’S SO FASCIST!!!!! CHECK YOUR PRIVILEGE, YOU WHITE CISHET SCUM!!!!!!!!! Is that logical? No. Do I care? Fuck no.I get off (not in that way! Stop objectifying women, you sexist asshole!) downtown and throw on the hoodie and bandana. I put on sunglasses too, just for good measure, even though it’s really cloudy today. I walk a block to the rally, where my friends and I spend the rest of the afternoon throwing around bricks and Molotov cocktails and beating up old men.It’s hard work overthrowing the privileged bigoted racist sexist homophobic transphobic heteronormative corporate bourgeois system, but we continue to fight. One day, my comrades, we shall prevail…*Disclaimer: the above answer is satirical. This is neither my daily routine nor an accurate representation of my political beliefs or those of many others who identify as liberals. Yeah. the end.
