There's really no such thing as a "typical day" - it is entirely dependent on, among a plethora of factors, the fund size ($10bn with plenty of manpower or a $100m fund with two analysts?), investment style (value vs. long/short), sector focus (utilities vs. tech), market conditions (is it 1999 or fall of 2008?), and your work ethics. Below is a rough draft of my schedule (please note that I'm in the Bay Area):4:30-5:00am: Crawl out of bed, turn on my computer, and jump straight to NYT, WSJ, FT, and CNBC - occasionally they provide great inspiration. Finally, check for analyst upgrades and downgrades. Sounds like there isn't enough time? A perfunctory glance should suffice for industry veterans, especially if you've been covering a name every trading day for the past five years.Oh, and sort through 50 e-mails. Most will be junk, but pay particular attention to e-mails from your most-trusted sell-side analysts. I personally love Bernstein Research since the quality of their work tends to be miles ahead of the rest.5:00-5:45am: Drive to the office. There's a surprising amount of traffic!5:45-6:10am: Log in to my Bloomberg machines. Stick seven eggs into the egg cooker. Quickly research whatever caught my attention when I woke up and prepare for the investment committee meeting. This could mean reading a couple of analyst reports or news articles.6:10-6:40am: Discuss overnight news with the CIO and portfolio managers, then plan the day out. Once the market is open, monitor price movements, as some of the biggest swings take place in the first 30min of the trading day.6:40-7:30am: Scour the web for more news, articles, etc. In addition to the aforementioned news sources, Google News, Bloomberg, and Facebook can occasionally be helpful.7:30-10:30am: Perform qualitative research on, say, PLNT by reading the IPO prospectus, the most recent 10-Q and earnings transcript, company presentation decks, CEO interviews, related news articles, company press releases, and analyst reports from JP Morgan and Bank of America. Since it's my job to figure out what the market has gotten wrong, I constantly pause and ask myself, "Is this logical?" The ideal scenario is if the answer is "No way, Jose" - this signals opportunity.10:00-11:30am: Once the qualitative work is complete, I need to quantity everything by building/updating models. I generally download them from Goldman Sachs's or Morgan Stanley's web-sites... you wouldn't believe how dysfunctional some of the other sell-side models are. Identify the key drivers and input my own assumptions (the assumptions need to be well supported by facts). Once the three statements are done, I prefer to have a comprehensive valuation tool box with DCF, comps, multiples, historicals, etc. Naturally, conduct a sensitivity analysis to ensure a margin of safety.11:30am-noon: Ring up a sell-side analyst, an industry expert, investor relations, or a friend. I need to verify my numbers and investment rationale from earlier. No room for error - my performance is black and white.Noon-1:00pm: Monitor the markets for price movements again. Recommend last-minute trades if necessary. If you're looking for plenty of liquidity, this is the time.1:00-1:30pm: Lunch. Unless sell-side has provided catered food for the day, get the fourth sandwich (for the week) that you know is tasteless, overpriced, and probably unhealthy.1:30-5:30pm: Check for after-market news. Jump on conference calls (if any). Read more analyst reports, industry reports, and/or SEC filings. Reading SEC filings is quite time-consuming. Once I'm "done", I'll readÂ  the competitors' reports and filings.5:30-6:30pm: Gym. Attend a 1-hr spin class or do 30min of cardio plus some weight-lifting and crunches.6:30-7:30pm: Drive home. Traffic is making my life miserable, but thank goodness I have classical music or Eminem playing in the background.7:30-8:10pm: Order overpriced Chinese take-out and eat in front of my computer at home while watching CEO interviews or Game of Thrones.8:15-8:45pm: Check e-mails and read the NYT, WSJ, CNBC, and FT (especially if there're macro risks). If time permits, read more SEC filings.8:45-9:00pm: Shower, brush my teeth, and get ready for bed.9:00-9:30pm: Get in bed. Read NYT on my iPhone. Lights out.I know plenty of analysts who're in the industry almost solely for the hefty compensation, and these tend to be the less dedicated ones. They are also the ones who will leave the office at 2:30pm on a week day, five minutes after the CIO has taken off. Some firms, particularly the long-term, value-oriented ones, are relatively lax in how much they demand from their analysts. The more intense ones, like SAC Capital, will slave you away (granted, nothing wrong with this).Hopefully this is of some help, but please keep in mind that the above is reflective solely of my hedge fund experience and should not be extrapolated to the broader hedge fund community.Note: I updated my answer on 9/17/2015 in part to reflect changes in my day-to-day. E.g. reduced reliance on CNBC.
