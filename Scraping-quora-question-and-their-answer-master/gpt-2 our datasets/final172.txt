We have a daily list of things to do to maintain our conservative ranking. Each thing is worth a certain amount of points. I racked up a lot of conservative points today:Told women what to do and how to act.Specifically, I told my youngest daughter that she had to eat breakfast and get dressed, and I told my oldest daughter to hurry up because I was ready to leave and she rides with me in the morning. (For the record, I did not have to tell my son these things, because he did them on his own. I did have to tell him to do his homework after school, though.)I made my wife wait until I was done showering downstairs before she took her shower upstairs, because otherwise neither of us would have enough hot water if we did it at the same time. (For the record, this is our normal morning routine. There was nothing special about it today.)I also told several female students to do things like: “get out your homework” and “focus on the board.” (For the record, I said these things to the class at large, half of which was female.)Silenced some minorities.Specifically, I told my students, some of whom happen to be minorities, to stop talking while I was teaching. (For the record, I told the whole class to stop talking while I was teaching, but some of them are minorities so it counts towards my total score for the day.)Imposed my will on the disabled.Specifically, I told the bagger at the grocery store, who has some sort of mental disability, that I wanted paper bags, not plastic. (For the record, he asked me. I wasn’t going to complain no matter what he put them in.)Told a female to get back in the house where she belonged.Specifically, it was a female dog… my dog, and told her to come inside because she was playing in the back yard and, honestly, I didn’t want to forget she was back there. I’ve forgotten sometimes.Refused to participate in socialism, to my own detriment.Specifically, my coworker asked on a group chat if I wanted coffee, because she was stopping for coffee anyway, and I politely refused. She was like 10 minutes too late… I already got my morning coffee by then, but I got McDonalds coffee and she brought Starbucks. I wish I would have participated in the socialism once I saw the good things it brought.I made the white male patriarchy proud today. I scored a solid 95/100 on the Reagan-o-meter. I get to keep my conservative badge, for now.
