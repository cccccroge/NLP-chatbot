You can never be at ease if your partner is a narcissist. Learned through experience, you never talk about your innermost thoughts with them because it may be used against you in the future. Your mental guard is always up. Anything that they say to you will be dissected in your head because you will be conditioned to believe there is an endgame involved.In the big picture, your narcissist spouse or significant other is now on the level of an acquaintance. Then you realize you have very few close friends or family members left you can talk with because you willingly alienated them or your partner sabotaged the relationship. This usually happens in the early stages of the relationship because your narcissist partner has taken you to Cloud 9, and you want to stay there. But it is temporary.The short answer. There is no “"typical” day. I can't remember having a normal day over the last 20+ years, and I do not see one coming for a while. It sucks on many levels.
