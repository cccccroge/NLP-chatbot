TW: I'm going anon because this is true and graphic.Not again. Why did I do that?I wake up beside my narc. Not even 12 hours ago, he had texted me that he wanted something back of his. I couldn't say no, because he was right. It belonged to him. Weeks ago he dumped me abruptly, and I've been very distraught. It ended weeks ago, so how does he keep finding possessions that I owe to give back to him? How does he keep finding ways to see me and talk to me, without telling me he wants to see and talk to me?I dont know. I got home to give him his things back. He was waiting for me on the lawn, drunk as hell. I told myself that I'd just give it to him and go to bed, I had work tomorrow.Why is he talking to me? Just days ago he told me what a pathetic piece of shit I am. How he left me because he wanted to marry someone else. I am weak. And I must be weak, because I am still talking to him, warming up to him by the minute.He grabs my ass without my consent and I snap at him. He feels so much guilt that he must go home, and I cant possibly let him drive home drunk, so I drive him myself. But now I'm at his house, in his room.And so we fuck.Because I'm weak. I'm a pathetic piece of shit with no self respect. He falls asleep basically mid-sex, no getting me off. No affection. I could've been a fleshlight for all he cared. But when I try to get up to leave, in his sleep, he begs me to stay. Because I matter. I matter, he says I matter. I stay.In the morning, he rolls over and fucks me again. This time, sober and awake, and then he rolls out of bed before I get my physical or emotional needs met. This time, the sex kind of hurt. He showers, this time without me unlike how we used to. He didnt want me to come in. Now I dont shower before work, nor have a change of clothes because all of my clothes he dropped off in a bag weeks ago. He makes himself breakfastNothing for me.He drops me off at work, and i ask him. Can we talk tonight? Please.He tells me he left me because I walk too slow, now he will be late to work because of me. He tells me he is seeing another girl tonight and doesnt have time to talk to me. I ask him if he will sleep with her. He says he doesnt know, but it's more important than me.Then he says his goodbye and walks away.I walk away as well. I turn the corner and I vomit.
