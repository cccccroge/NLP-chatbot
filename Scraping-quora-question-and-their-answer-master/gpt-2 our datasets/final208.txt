Get into the office at 9:29. Just in time for stand up. 29 minutes later than the boss wants but was up until 2am catching up on game of thrones so who cares.Discuss said game of thrones marathon until 9:35 when stand up finally starts.Bug found in data layer. Much discussion, little action. Stand up lasts 20 minutes. That's OK, grab a coffee and time to write some code.... sit down at machine and check twitter. Kent Beck said what?!?!? Must retweet that one! 10:15 - time to write some code.... Keith from sales bursts in. High priority estimate required! Millions of dollars! Must be done NOW! Boss assigns me and.... ffs Dwayne?!Grab a refill and discuss estimate. Keith needs to get Bill to explain scope but Bill is in a meeting. Wait 5 for Bill. Finally someone who can explain scope. This swag session would be a lot faster if Andy wasn't always pushing to use the library he has been working on. 11:45. No point starting now its lunchtime. Head to subway (not the one on 4th though - they don't have mountain dew). Get back to desk and eat lunch.1:30 - oops, spent a bit too long on Reddit. Anyway, time to write some code.... oh shit forgot today was team meeting. That's OK, zone out for an hour. In fact an hour and 15 this week.Back to desk. Devops have found a huge issue in the framework layer. I think they forgot to deploy the latest jar. Nope - they swear its all up to date. Spend half hour hacking around. They forgot to deploy the latest jar. But we didn't put instructions on the wiki! Update wiki....OK I need a coffee. 4pm.... finally time to write some code.... Overhear debate.... don't get involved.... stay focused.... WHAT?? How can setter injection possibly be faster!?!? Well if we were using scala then it wouldn't be an issue anyway. Yes I agree, we need coding standards. 4:45. Well to be honest there is not much point starting now, I mean it is bad practice to leave un-submitted code overnight, especially since the Indian team will probably try and refactor it all anyway! May as well leave early. I will come in early tomorrow morning to make up the time....
