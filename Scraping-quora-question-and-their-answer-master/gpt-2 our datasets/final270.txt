From my experience:I lucid dream almost every night; if not, I still dream every night, and to be frank, lucid dreaming hasn’t affected me much, but it is definitely an amazing experience!Why does it not affect me?I see no significance it in, because when I wake up from a dream, I remember it very well, but after a moment or two of processing it, I realized I’ve seen those particular objects in my dream before in my waking day. I purport the theory that dreams are merely results of our brains sorting out memories, nothing mystical.
