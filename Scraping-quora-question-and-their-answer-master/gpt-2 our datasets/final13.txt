My typical day as an intern was like this:7:30am: wake up, get ready, eat9am: drink 4 teas to be energized and do work till lunch, probably prepping work, maybe meeting in afternoon12pm: lunch1pm: more work3pm: meeting with manager, present work, show direction, areas of interest4pm: meet with larger group, show work, direction5pm: get a snack, leave.This is basically every day. Some days have more meetings, more important meetings, meet with important people, different types of people to work with.After that, as far as the “Silicon Valley” aspect, it was my personal life, and not very tied in with the culture. However being at the workplace you know a lot of at least your company.Then I’d eat some food, and do whatever in the evening, and hang with friends on weekend.
