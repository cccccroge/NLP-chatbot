Here’s a glimpse into my ultra-stereotypical life. I’m a Christian, a conservative, a stay at home wife and mother, and a second-generation homeschooler. Brace yourself.I start with reading the news, of course:Soon it’s footwear time - I mean, what kind of an American ARE you if you don’t own boots?Bacon and more bacon and more bacon and more bacon, with a sirloin steak on the side and my homegrown eggs would be natural:You have to own a thick braided paracord bracelet to be in the club:Ready for the day, I can now nervously kneel and implore my husband to give me some worn bills from his envelope system, of course:I can then grab my camo backpack:And stash my conceale(r) carry arsenal inside:Outside, the Trump-sticker-plastered pickup flying a Confederate would of course be waiting:And I fear no man, for I’m carrying:And so, possibly in my stringy hair, broken teeth, bad breath, and tshirt with camo cap:And with a nervous glance over at my husband who would (of course perfectly legally) be threatening me and controlling my voice, I prepare for the sacred duty of all Americans:The end.Probably not written with natural berry ink on an American-made cornstalk, while gnashing beef jerky and listening to talk radio.
