I have now become that elderly parent.I got up at 6 am, ate some cereal, got my gear together. Did my 8 mile cycling ride. Pulled my front tire off my bike and polished the rim and spokes. It was whining for some attention after putting over 200 miles on it last month. Trying to get in shape for a 500 mile ride on the Natchez Trace from Nashville, TN to Natchez, MS.A very scenic federal highway with a reduced speed limit. Trees all along the ride, so camping is every where. Short rides off the trace to resupply points. Maybe 2 weeks. Since I'm a backpacker, hiker, canoist, hang glider pilot, mountain climber, I have all the equipment for most adventures.Perhaps some day it will cost me my life. We all die, some people just never learn how to live! 63 years young, retired, 40 years still married to my bride, and now best of all, a new granddaughter!Oh yea, I'll spoil her rotten! Already got her 105 outfits, a $25,000 wedding ring, you should see my wife's.But this is the privilege of old men, to spoil wives and children.
