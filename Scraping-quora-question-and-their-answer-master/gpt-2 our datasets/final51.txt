Well I see a lot of good answers for the typical day of “a” PhD candidate in CS, but let me give you a sort of different perspective from the viewpoint of someone who was one until 2 years ago while raising 2 wonderful young people.When you’re a single parent in grad school, you're forced to become a morning person even though you're originally a night owl. You wake up at 4:00 am to give yourself some time to think about your problem. You take a look at that paper your advisor gave you the other day and expects you to read and report on. It reminds you of another paper that you know of that is even more relevant to your problem, which in turn reminds you of yet a third one that just might have the right answer for you. You keep following this trail of references and thoughts, maybe sketch some ideas on paper (or on the wall!) and then BAM! It's 6:30 am! Time to wake up the kidos.You pack lunch boxes, make breakfast, wake them up, make sure they brush their teeth and hair, make sure they eat breakfast, make sure they have the right shoes on on the right day (my daughter once wore flats to school on a snowy day and almost had a frost bite). You get them out the door and on the bus and now time to start your day. You head to the lab, try to catch back that trail of thoughts you had in the morning but to no avail. You start doing some implementation work, work on figuring out those bugs that have been driving you nuts, finish that paper review you promised your advisor you’ll do, maybe give yourself a short break then back to your code. You prepare for a lab meeting or discussion, check out social media and see all the shenanigans going around about how this site is going to delete people’s accounts if they don't share a particular post, or how this techie is going to use machine learning to finally make the world a better place and let all humans live happily ever after.. you write a couple of comments expressing how you feel about all this and then you decide to switch from dismay to gratitude! You make a conscious decision to be thankful for the fact that you know a little better, then move on with your work.You start driving around 5 pm, starving! You pick up the kids from their after school care then head to the grocery store, pick up the quickest and least damaging meal you can cook for the day. You want to make sure you minimize damage to both their health and your bank account.You immediately jump in the kitchen, move faster than you ever thought was possible, try to get that meal ready before these cute little creatures turn to cannibalisme. Food’s ready, you get them to do their homework, hopefully without yelling! You yell once and then decide you need to calm down.. need to get that bug in your code off your mind.. need to put aside that deadline and really capture the moment. Your kids are only going to grow up once but deadlines will never end. You tell yourself that and try to act like a grown up now.. like a real parent and all. You decide what the heck! Let's get out and play for a while. You find that incredibly rewarding feeling of giving some of your time to the people you love most while at the same time getting a much needed exercise for your body. Now time to get the kids in bed. Make sure they brush, make sure they have pajamas on, off to bed. Your youngest starts asking for that bedtime story you used to tell before you joined grad school but there's noway! You’ve already spent way too many hours away from your work and definitely need to get back to work now. You tell your kid maybe I’ll do it tomorrow or maybe after that deadline coming up.By the time they're asleep, you're too tired to work out your problem or develop theory around it but you still have some energy to hunt down whatever remains of those bugs in your code. You check answers online for similar errors but none of them works for you. Maybe you post your own question, and get exclamation marks (usually from software engineers) on why in the world you want to do what you're trying to do! No one has done it before and no one has a clue. You end up figuring it out on your own or sleeping on it (and sometimes dreaming of it). And then you wake up 6 hours later to do it all over again.
