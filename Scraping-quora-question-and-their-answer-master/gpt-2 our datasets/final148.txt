Well I am an elderly parent. I can tell you how my husband and I spend our day. We go to a number of doctors throughout the week for various parts of our body. We grocery shop together. We like to go out to eat frequently. We welcome friends and visitors to our home whenever they come through. We like to get work done on our home (not by us) and we love to sit on our back deck and watch and feed the birds when it is the coolest part of the day.We both are writers. I have published several books. My husband does not publish but he likes to write and I help him edit. I like to listen to music, communicate on the computer, and watch Netflix. Our kids are grown up and out grandbabies are all furry with 4 paws each. We like to travel to Austin and Orlando to see them whenever we can and enjoy their visits.We are starting up at a Citizen Police Academy which I am excited about. We do lots of volunteer work. I volunteered all last year at an elementary school. We also planned and carried out a lunch for the police last month, a big event,We do take naps during the day.We like to visit others, but usually friends and family. We donâ€™t travel far away just to be a tourist. We are basically homebodies, but will always take time to see the kids.
