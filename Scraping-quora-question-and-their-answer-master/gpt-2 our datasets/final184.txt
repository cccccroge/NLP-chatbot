I’m a completely normal conservative in every way. When I get out of my bed I kick my dog as I walk by him. Next I go to the bathroom and fill a glass with cold water. Then I return to my bed and dump the water on my wife’s head so that she knows it’s time to get up. For breakfast I have one of the neighbor’s cats, captured the night before, which is a total win because the entire process is both entertaining AND a cheap source of protein.I roll in to work in my Hummer and park across 3 spaces after intentionally driving over one of the islands with flowers in it. After badging-in and simultaneously pushing open BOTH double doors, I stroll through the middle. If someone is coming the other way they better fucking look out. While walking to my office I slap one of the secretaries (not EAs) on the ass and grab some junior guy’s coffee from him. After settling into a gigantic leather chair in my wainscoted office, which sports several endangered animal heads on the wall, I surf porn for about a half hour. Next I decide that I have to go motivate my team so I head out to the sales floor and begin shouting at the men, screaming obscenities when necessary. To the women I’m much kinder, I whisper threats into their ear, usually physical threats. They appreciate the whispering and it keeps me cool with HR. I go to lunch for 3 hours and return, drunk on gin. I stick around until three and inform my team that I expect them to stay until seven, if they like their jobs. I head for the door. I always do a couple donuts in the Hummer on the way out of the lot because I know how much it makes everyone else wish they had a Hummer, and wish they were me.Off to the dog fights. I always pick the wimpy looking dogs and then pay one of the handlers to inject it with liquid cocaine. Both dogs typically die this way but mine almost always dies last, so I win.My wife has cooked an extravagant meal with the help of our illegal immigrant maid Rosaria; so I get a box of Chow Mein from Hunan Kitchen and eat it in my Hummer while listening to country music really loud. I go home, pissed off about all the illegals that are in my country. At home everyone knows that they are not allowed to talk to me (or look at me) so I breeze on in and head to my den and flip on my 3 flat screens that surround me (1) porn (2) porn (3) fox news… I stay here until bedtime.repeat… repeat… repeat
