There was no typical day in my experience. Apart from it started with my exhaustion and ended with my exhaustion.The co-dependant/caretaker part of me, was in overdrive from the minute I opened my eyes.Towards the end Iâ€™d take responsibility for the location of car keys and wallet. As I just couldnâ€™t take the chaos in the mornings when he couldnâ€™t find things. Iâ€™d started to sneak off to the bedroom to watch telly in the evenings alone, as the loud speaker phone calls with everyone he knew, or the constant channel change on tv every 5 minutes, because he was so bored and couldnâ€™t concentrate for longer than that time a on programme. Then if his boredom got too much, heâ€™d play his favourite game of criticising my every word or move. Resulting in an argument I had to apologise for.The only typical daily thing for four years was my constant shoulder/neck/head/pain (symptoms of chronic anxiety) and that was the first thing to go. When the insanity of daily life with him was over.I couldnâ€™t and wouldnâ€™t want to keep up with him. The last time I saw him, he was moving so fast, I coulda swore he was on roller skates ðŸ˜‚
