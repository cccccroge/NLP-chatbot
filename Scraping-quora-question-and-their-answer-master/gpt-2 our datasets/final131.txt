Mom will be 90 in a few months but she’s doing really well. She lives here with my husband and me. Her typical day starts around 9 AM when we hear her “stair chair” fire up. As it descends, she greets the pups who are happy to see her because she feeds them.She usually makes a breakfast for herself while getting the 4 dogs’ food ready. She likes to heat it up and makes a big deal of it. She reads the newspaper for hours.My brother usually calls before noon and they discuss their bowel problems. It’s really pretty gross, but it’s a topic they cover daily. She usually has some type of appointment in the afternoon, hair or doctor, so she drives if it’s nearby. If it’s too far away, I’ll take her and we will go out to lunch.She gets home and does dishes and laundry. She finds something to clean all day long. We have a housekeeper, but Mom still has to wipe the counters, the glass doors, etc. It’s good exercise for her.She usually takes a nap in the afternoon and has a Crown Royal and water around 5 PM. We eat dinner around 7:30 and watch Fox News and or some Netflix movie after the news. She goes to bed between 11 pm and midnight.My father, on the other hand, lived here for 3 years. When he was 85, he decided he didn’t want to live as an old man. He didn’t like the slow down and worried that he would become a burden for me. He shot himself in my dining room. It was devastating. It seemed like it was going to be a normal day, but it was not. His autopsy showed very little wrong with him physically, except the bullet that went through his brain.
