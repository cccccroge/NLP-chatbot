Well, here’s what my day was like today, which is pretty typical.[About me: I own my own small business, my husband is a co-founder and chief product officer of a venture-funded startup, we have 2 kids ages 11 & 13. We live equidistant between Facebook HQ and Stanford University. My friends and neighbors work at startups, Google, Apple, Facebook, Stanford, and NASA but they are also VCs, lawyers, doctors, teachers, bankers, therapists, consultants and more.]7 AM Wake up, get my kids up7.30 Hubby leaves to drive to Santa Clara for 8 AM meeting7.45 Kid #1 out the door to catch the bus to middle school8 AM Kid #2 rides bike to school. We need milk and I don’t want to deal with traffic so I walk to the store. Back to home office to do a couple hours’ work.10 AM Meeting in trendy Menlo Park coffee shop, Coffeebar. Hard to get a seat, it’s packed. We talk about her startup, brainstorm business ideas for me, and chat about the crazy housing prices, the awful traffic, and the amazing weather.11 AM Head back home, phone calls in the car on the way. Schedule another meeting for Monday at another trendy Palo Alto coffee shop with potential new client.Noon: I bring a salad to my 87 year old next door neighbor. We have lunch together and catch up. We talk about her health, but also the crazy housing prices and the amazing weather.1 PM Lunch ends quickly when I am interrupted with text messages and phone calls regarding a client.3.30 PM Kids home from school, disrupting my peace. Nag kids to put away their stuff, have a snack, and start their homework, then I get back to work.5.30 PM Feed kids dinner. Get in the car to take one kid to baseball. Traffic is horrible and it takes us 30 minutes to get somewhere that should take 10 minutes. Other kid is at home preparing cookie dough for a girl scout bake sale tomorrow.8 PM Hubby is home. He aims to come home later to avoid the traffic.8.30 PM Hubby & I eat dinner, then watch TV or chat or go over the weekend schedule / summer schedule / vacation planning / other misc endless items on the to-do list.10.30 PM BedOh I forgot, I also paid some bills, opened some mail, did some dishes, sent thank you emails to various friends for various Memorial Day weekend parties, and looked at the kids’ summer camp schedule.Livin’ the dream, right?
