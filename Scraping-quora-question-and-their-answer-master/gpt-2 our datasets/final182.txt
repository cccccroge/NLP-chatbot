I wake up in the morning, and have a hearty breakfast of whooping crane eggs. Maybe spotted owl eggs if I’m feeling adventurous.I go outside and chop down a tree.After I’ve chopped down my daily tree, my chauffeur drives me (in my pickup truck with a gun rack, of course) to my job working for the military-industrial complex. My specific job is taking money from poor people and funneling it directly to oil companies. I have binders full of women to help me do this.Eventually, it’s lunchtime. For lunch, I demand an entire roasted Nene bird. That’s a lot of food though, which I usually can’t finish. I make sure to throw the rest in the garbage, because sharing is for libtards.After lunch, I return to work. I’m currently spearheading a project to remove wheelchair ramps from VA hospitals and train stations - if people can’t walk, it’s their own problem.After work, I’m stressed out - all that oppressing doesn’t come easy, you know. So I have my chauffeur drive me to the range, where I shoot all my fully semi automatic assault rifles which I bought through the gun show loophole. I make sure to load the high-capacity .30 caliber banana magazine clips with armor-piercing “cop killer” bullets. On the way home from the range, I make sure to stop and deposit my daily earnings/embezzlements into my offshore bank account. After all, why pay taxes? Let the poor do that!By now, it’s been a long day, and I’m quite happy to get home to my mansion, which is built on the former site of some low-income housing which I had razed for my own use. It’s time for dinner by now, and I expect a blue whale steak or leg of Florida panther or something like that. I know my staff will prepare it just to my liking - what do I pay them 35 cents an hour for? Plus, if they don’t, I’ll just have them deported.After dinner, I go outside and chop down another tree.When I’ve chopped down this last tree, it’s getting close to time for bed. So, I go inside, say my proper Westboro Baptist Church prayers, and go to sleep. Tomorrow is another big day!
