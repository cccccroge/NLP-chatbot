It varies depending on which lab you work in.  When I was working in social network analysis a typical day was like8:00 - wake up9:30 - go to class11:00 - go to lab, talk to people, maybe get some coding done12:00 - get free food (there were group meetings twice a week and seminars on most of the other days)1:00 - 6:00 - program, do homework, talk to people about class projects, talk to people about other things (I was surprised at how much talking there was in grad school)6:00 - 10:00 - linger in lab because it's too cold to bike home10:00 - bike home11:30 - bedNow I have a much less healthy schedule where I rarely go to lab or talk to anyone.  (I work in a different lab now, and do theoretical work.)  Sometimes I go to Starbucks and read papers or try to prove theorems.  There is basically no coding and I don't need a computer most of the time.(By the way, I'm a first-year PhD, and I'm still taking classes and rotating through advisors.  Fifth-year PhDs probably have different schedules.)
