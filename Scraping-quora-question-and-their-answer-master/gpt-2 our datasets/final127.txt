Well… I’m not sure I even have a typical day. But like many, this one began around 6:00am, with my wife Lizzie getting ready for work and asking me questions while I’m still asleep. If for some reason she doesn’t do that, I’m up by about 7:00am anyway.I make to the couch — she’s already got hot coffee made and the television on. I actually do prefer MS-NBC, but she enjoys tales of carnage, fluffery, weather and traffic on the local news. If she’s got Fox on, I probably bump it to one of the others… CBS is the one with the hot traffic girl.After some coffee and after my wife’s done with the bathroom, I brush teeth, shave, and shower, etc. Then I get dressed… but of course, I wear something like this:Funny thing is that today, I actually am wearing this shirt. And pants… though in the summer, shorts are perfectly acceptable. I can do that because I worked really hard in college and afterwards to get a sweet job in technology where they pay little attention to the way I look or dress and all sorts of attention to my ability to design electronics that work. I can often work at home — currently have a better PC and better electronics lab at home than at work. It’s a small company, and from years of working at startups, I amassed all the gear I need to do my work at home…. except a spectrum analyzer. Maybe some day.When I do go into the office, I get in my silver 2010 Prius — not my favorite color in a car, but I bought this one at less than 1/2 price with 52,000 miles on it — turn on satellite radio, and drive the roughly 28 miles between Newark DE and Downington PA.Delware is currently one of the all-Blue states. I just moved to Newark from South Jersey about a year-and-a-half ago. Despite generally being a liberal state, we had the nightmare of Chris Christie for eight years, but it was fantastic to see Phil Murphy replace him.I lived in the part of South Jersey that’s “Pretty Much Alabama”, just a bit east of Woodstown on 26 acres of forest along US 40. So we actually had a Republican Congressman, Frank LoBiondo. Thus, curiously, the very first Congressperson I ever helped to elect was Lisa Blunt Rocester in 2016. But I digress…Once at the office, it’s normal day of engineering work. Which means that everyday it’s different… progress means never making the same mistake twice. Ideally, anyway. Sometimes it’s on a big project my company’s doing for that largest of all Socialist programs yet invented by mankind: the US Military. We developed a digital radio system for the US Army that, unlike many of the other digital radio sytems used by the US Military, actualy works very well.I’m currently also working on a low-end computer/radio platform for our commerical/industrial products. Nothing you necessarily ever heard of, though if you watch Football in the USA, you might have noticed that starting two seasons ago, the coaches on the sidelines don’t have cables trailing from them any longer — they’re wireless. That’s a custom-made radio system we made for that most liberal of entities, the National Football League.On the way home from work, I could get MS-NBC on the satellite radio, but lately I’ve been listening to the “Indie 1.0” station on SiriusXM. Which, naturally, is an Internet-only channel, so I’m streaming through my phone into the car audio system. I sometimes get takeout, otherwise my wife will likely have made dinner. She’s a 2nd Grade Teacher in Jersey, a Union member, so as well as the fact she’s home way before I am, we’re on her healthcare, not mine. And she’s got a pension! Remember those?I have a small bar area in the office/mancave/music room in the cellar, including a beer fridge. I pretty much always have some decent microbrew on-hand, right now I have some Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA. Oh, and Guinness, because it’s March. I like beer with dinner, she likes cheap table wine… from a box. Go figure.We usually watch television after dinner, increasingly something on-demand, often IPTV like Netflix or Amazon… I have a gigabit internet connection via a fiber optic connection. That’s from a private company (Verizon), but was, of course, developed based in large on governement funded research. As was the whole internet, of course. But strangely enough, we liberals are not at all opposed to private enterprise — you’ll find most people in technology lean liberal, simply because we’re more educated than average, and that is where higher education leads you. Which is why Republicans are constantly oppposing education — you can’t believe they support anything they’re working so hard to dismantle, eh?Since I moved, I’ve been making the new place “smart”, with all sorts of Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Wifi based IoT devices. There’s only one small lamp switched on the garage, but when you switch it on or off, some overhead lights track it’s state. The light in laundry room is driven my a motion sensor, so there’s never any need to fumble for the lights when carrying laundry in or out. The outdoor lights come on 15 minutes after sunset, and go off at 10pm. All the lights in the house are LED lights, most dimmable, and my IoT system and two televisions are hooked in via Amazon’s Echo/Alexa. If the smoke alarm in the cellar goes off, the furnace automatically shuts down. If the CO2 alarm in the garage door goes off, the door automatically opens (so yeah, now you know how to break in to my grarge!) If any indoor alarm goes off, most of the lights automatically come on. If we go away, our usual use pattern of lights and TVs continues, to make it look like we’re home and to keep the cats less stressed. My expectation is that it took longer to set this all up than I’ll ever get back in time saved, but it’s still pretty cool to be able to control most things in the house from anywhere in the world.My wife usually goes to sleep around 9pm… she needs lots of sleep. I don’t. I retire to my office/man-cave/music room in the cellar. Since November, I’ve been posting a new black and white photo on Facebook every day, so I often get that taken care of. I’ve also been moving that series to G+, Instagram, and 500px… slowly. Sometimes I practice my guitar playing and/or write original songs. Sometimes I get back to work on the thing I was working on for work during the day, particularly if I’m managed to come up with new ideas while relaxing. Sometimes I even write articles here on Quora.Sometimes at night I watch the Rachael Maddow Show at 12am… other times, not so much. I also read the New York Times, the Washington Post, lots of various science and engineering magazines, the occasional photography magazine… all electronically. The best way to stay informed based on objective reality is to read a variety of materials. Never rely on a single source of information, even if it’s one that tells you things you want to hear all the time. Most people have very little to fear about being manipulated by news they don’t trust. But if you’re too dependent on any one source of information, you are asking to be manipulated. Ideally, that’s something all educated people should watch out for, not just liberals. Democracy only works when most of us base our decisions on objective truth. Propaganda is how the Nazis and the Soviets controlled their people, and North Korea still does.I usually get to bed by 3:30am…. if I don’t, I’m supposed to crash out on the couch so I don’t wake Lizzie up too close to her normal get-up time, around 5:30am. Our four cats enjoy it when I so sleep on the couch, they often join me.On the weekends, we usually go on an organized hike in the mornings with a local hiking group, usually at public parks and wilderness areas. Delaware State parks are funded in-part by parking fees, but you can get a season pass for $35 if you’re a resident. Except during yard sale season, when we drive around to buy stuff. I rarely buy anything, but occasionally find musical instruments or cameras. But I’m there to carry the stuff she buys and, of course, I always have cash. I’ve also recently joined a photography group that takes trips around to see interesting things.CodaCuriously, if the question had been about a day in the life of a hardware engineer, a day in the life of an amateur musician or photographer, a day in the life of a recent “empty-nester”, etc. I would have had pretty much the same answer, perhaps with additional elaborations about the topic-in-question and fewer about political leanings. But it’s critical for everyone to keep in mind that you are an individual, the sum of all of your influences.People these days self-identify in very silly ways with things that ultimately deserve only a tiny fraction the importance given them. You’re more a Republican than an American, more a Nikon advocate than a Photographer, more a Metalhead than an actual musician, more an Anti-vaxxer or gun nut than a parent. More a tribesman working hard for the benefit of some wealthy overlord, less a unique, modern, civil individual in charge of what befits you, those close to you, your neighbors, your society and culture. Something seems to be a little lost, a little broken in some people.My advice: go out and meet people as some other aspect of yourself. Especially an aspect you haven’t been feeding lately. This morning, I met with 20 other hikers and went hiking for nearly five miles. I wasn’t a liberal, I wasn’t an electronics engineer, I wasn’t a beer enthusiast. I was a photographer.. those things go together. I had a good time with other hikers. I couldn’t tell you their politics or their rung on the socioeconomic ladder. Next Saturday, I have my “regular Saturday night thing” in Philadelphia with about 30 other musicians. Ok, there’s a bit more beer enthusiasm as well, but it’s about music. Anyone who wants to play — regardless of skill level — or wants to listen is welcome… we leave that other stuff home.It's funny when you get that close, it's kind of hard to hate. -Harry Chapin
