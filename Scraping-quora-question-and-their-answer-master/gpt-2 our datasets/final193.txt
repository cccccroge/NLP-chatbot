I wake up at around 1 p.m. after a night of heavy drinking. After vomiting and heaving for half an hour in my dirty bathroom, I crawl to the kitchen and drink some tap water while lying on the floor. By 3 p.m. I usually wake up in the kitchen and am now ready to start my day. I fix myself a bowl of Frosted Flakes, turn on the TV and watch House of Cards till I'm bored. At 5 p.m. I start to feel guilty and wonder, Why am I so special that I don't have to work in an office? I conclude I am a genius. This makes me feel really good. I stand up, shower, making sure to wash my—by now exceedingly oily—face and then go to my 'study.' My study is not really so studious. It is a small room with lots of unread books and a shaky table with a laptop on it. After checking my emails and reading Quora till 10 p.m., I begin to write. Usually by 2 a.m. (the time when my friends call me to go out drinking again), I've written at least a few pages of execrable prose that I'll throw out the next day.
