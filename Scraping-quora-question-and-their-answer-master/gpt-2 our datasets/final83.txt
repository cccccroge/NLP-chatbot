The following is an article on the same subject titled 'A Day in the Life', from the 2012 issue of Sizzling Sands, the BITS Goa Annual Magazine.A Day in the LifeMy  day begins in room A-602. No, wait, that’s not quite right, is it? Just  because I wake up somewhere does not mean that’s where my day begins.  No, my morning began much earlier, when, mid-way through one of my  deep-sleep turnovers, I happened to look up, glance at the alarm clock  the sound of which had long since ceased to have anything close to the  desired effect upon me, gulped, and fallen out of bed, possibly onto  someone sleeping on the floor next to me. I assume after that I spent a  few hurried minutes dropping things and borrowing stuff, and I feel sure  I must have squeezed in time to brush and wash my face too. But you  see, between the attending of a class and the first rising, all the  interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream, and there isn’t much I  can tell you about it and still be considered a reliable narrator.I  look around, and realise I’m in a Thermodynamics class. I mean I must  be, because the entire row of students in front of me, of which I would  otherwise have picked one familiar face to interrogate, is either asleep  or as close to being so as I am. The seat next to me is empty, and I  get the feeling that I ought to infer something important from that, but  I can’t quite put my finger on what. I look up, and notice the teacher  looking straight at me. He smiles, and continues with his lecture.I  wake up again, this time hunched over a table outside Ice N’ Spice, the  campus eatery right outside my hostel. It is now four in the afternoon,  and I am told my lectures are over for the day. There is a bowl of  cheese Maggi before me, without any cheese of course, and an empty mug  next to it, with a straw in it. Clearly, I can’t have been asleep the  whole time, since I’ve been ordering. So even though I remember nothing  at all of a morning full of classes, I have concluded that I sleepwalk,  and talk, and quite well at that. Feeling cheerful suddenly, having  realised that the day so far hadn’t been a complete waste, I head on  home for the evening’s entertainment.Changing  my mind just before I open the door to my own room, I unlock and knock  on a friend’s instead. Fat takes 5 full minutes to open the door, and  when he does, he announces that he’s only just woken up.“Really? I toh woke up around 9 today.”“Kya be? Mujhe bhi utha deta, main bhi classes attend karke kuchh seekh leta. You attended all the classes na?”“Of course.”“Top marega tu iss sem.”“Hmm.”Fat’s  evening breakfast and a game of table-tennis take up the next two  hours. The latest episode of Game Of Thrones, an episode of House and  dinner take us through the next few. When we return to the hostel, the  common room is quickly filling up with students, some seniors, but  mostly irritated juniors. One senior steps into the centre of the throng  and starts speaking.“Just  wait here two minutes, Champak, our candidate for the post for  Vice-President would like to speak to you. Just two minutes and Champak  will be here…”Fat  and exchange a quick glance and rush for his room. Fat gets inside,  tosses me his lock, then closes the door again. I lock him in with his  own lock, with an understanding to let him out as soon as the seniors  have left and any form of harassment is unlikely. Not wanting to listen  to any preaching myself, I head for another friend’s room, a Bengali. Da  opens his door, and cries:“Arre Surd! What happened, not listening to the agendas?”“Shut up. Nutella nikaal.”Da  quickly lets me in, latches his door and brings out the jar of Nutella.  The next hour passes in satisfied silence, sitting on Da’s ridiculously  comfortable bed.We begin to discuss matters of the heart.“So. Who’re you voting for anyway?”“Her.”“Her? Why her?”“Cos she’s a her.”“Hmm.”Another  hour in silence. Silence apart from the sound of spoons being licked. I  am slowly becoming aware of that ever-prevalent danger of falling  asleep on Da’s bed, but I ignore it.“So. No quiz today?”“No. No dance practice today?”“No. No debate or something today?”“No. No random entrepreneurial something-something today?”“No.”“Hmm.”My conversations with Da have always been deep. In any case, he helps pass the time.“So.”“Hmm?”“Night mess?”“Dude, it’s 3 a.m. Everything’s closed.”I  look surprised. Da laughs at me and informs me he’s going to a  neighbour’s room to play a game of FIFA and will be back in a minute. I  tell him I’ll wait for him, and lie down.I  wake up in C-308. A look around informs me I’m in a Probability and  Statistics class. An empty seat next to me reminds me Fat’s still locked  in his room, but probably asleep. A sinking feeling tells me this is  exactly what occurred yesterday.This has got to stop happening.The next issue of Sizzling Sands is expected in November 2013.
