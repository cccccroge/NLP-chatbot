I have no elderly parents, or parents at all, so I will treat you to a glimpse of my ‘rave-a-minute’ life style. It is the lifestyle of Sally Alter the one who has bipolar 1 disorder.This means CHAOS.I wake up miserable because I have insomnia and my cat Minki is yowling at my door. No amount of screaming at him does a bit of good, he seems to get a great deal of pleasure out of exercising his lungs.So I roll out of bed already in a filthy mood. When my feet touch the floor, pain shoots down my right leg from my wonky hip and I have to hobble to the bathroom. Where is my cane? I must have left it in the living room at the other end of the house. Then I inevitably trip over Goldie, my silent cat, because she always lies in front of the toilet, and I have no idea where I left my glasses.By this time, I am in a very bad mood indeed.Due to my bipolar disorder routines are out. People who have no problem with routines, like my brother, just cannot understand what I mean by this, but my routines have to be written down, stuck on the fridge, and followed to the letter.Get up,go to the bathroom,take thyroid tablet (this has to be taken at least one hour before eating),feed the cats,change the litter,make the tea,take my tablets,have breakfast,answer emails and write on Quora.I generally lose track half way down the list due to bipolar distractions. Or I just skip the whole lot and write on Quora, number 9 on the list. I sometimes remember to count out my medicines, all seven of them, plus vitamins, put them in the bowl but totally forget them because I get distracted by something like the kettle is boiling beause I forgot to make the tea which was number 6 on the list. There the tablets sit for hours until I happen to notice them around 10.30 am when it is time for another cup of tea. The English are the greatest tea drinkers known to man.By this time I am worn out, so fall back into bed and sleep some more, wake up in a worse mood and start all over again.My days are not important because I spend most of my time on my computer writing on Quora. I have absolutely no idea what I did before Quora. I also paint, sew, make crafts and do DIY. As for routines - I have no routines. Not like my mother (and my brother) who swear by routines. The laundry doesn’t get done on Mondays, the floors don’t get swept on Tuesdays, I don’t eat fish on Fridays and I don’t rest on Sundays - I rest most of the other days.I am supposed to call Dietert, my local activity center, between 8 and 10 am. because I am a member of the Reassurance Program. The routine goes like this.Call in between 8 and 10 am,if I don’t, they call me.If I don’t answer they call the number on my call list,if that person is out they call the police.I can’t tell you how many times I have had a big, burly policeman banging on my door when I am in the shower. If I ever remember to call them it is a miracle. I get, ‘Sally, is that you?’ Then a very worried voice, ‘Are you OK?’ This is an expression of surprise because I remembered to call them.My days are very often filled with appointments:Mondays, physical therapy.Tuesdays, some doctor or the other.Wednesdays, physical therapy.Thursdays, psychotherapist,Fridays, another lovely doctor.What the #%#$$ did I do before the medical profession became my social life?The big problem is I never know what day it is. The days are all the same. When I am asked, ‘Did you have a nice weekend?’ I have no idea what they are talking about. So it’s medical appointments, bank, post office, shopping, and if I am in mania a very long trip to the mall to buy more lovely clothes that I never wear except in the house or at the doctor’s office. He always tells me, ‘You look very smart today’. I have a very nice doctor.Oh, but the real problem is I usually forget to look in my diary, or worse can never find it. Then - panic - throwing cushions all over the room, shouting at the cat, ‘What have you done with my diary?’ Then, in desperation, I go to the computer which is always on, and look at the date bottom right. As it only gives the day and the month I have to work out the days. When did I go to the dentist? Oh, yes, last Friday, so three days from that, it must be Monday. Oh, no, physical therapist in fifteen minutes. Fortunately, I am the speediest dresser on the planet so am out of my house in ten minutes, five breathless minutes to get to physical therapy.My evenings are spent:Writing on Quora,watching TV,Watching Netflix,Watching You Tube videos,Writing emailsWriting to pen pals - of which there are hordes in all different countries and on all different web sites.Then it’s medications, if I remember them, and to bed for another night of insomnia.
