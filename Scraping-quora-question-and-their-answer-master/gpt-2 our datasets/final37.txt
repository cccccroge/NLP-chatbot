In the ED, there is really no such thing as a 'typical' work day.We can arrive to no patients (as rare as the finest Van Gogh) or, more typically, we can be confronted by 60-70 patients at 07.00.Like the Boy Scouts, we need to be prepared. So an important part of our day needs to be spent stocking vital equipment, checking the equipment and ensuring that we have enough 'consumables'.Then it really is 'luck of the draw'.A few weeks ago, I was inducting new members of staff to our resuscitation room. Within minutes of our shift starting the 'red phone' rang. We were pre-alerted to the arrival of a trauma patient. All hands on deck - including the new staff who had only ever dealt with trauma simulation with a mannequin.We had ten minutes to check equipment, call the 'trauma team', don protective clothing and mentally prepare.The patient was critically injured, the demands on all of the staff were huge - this was a difficult patient to manage. We gave 4 units of blood in the first 20 minutes - the nursing staff had to liaise with blood bank, X ray, theatre etc.The patient was taken to theatre for life saving surgery.Although the trauma patient was the sickest patient, there were many other patients who also needed attention. (Blood tests; ECG recordings; medication; assessment; recording of vital signs)The patient departed - the Resus bay was 'trashed' (English word for in a mess) - all equipment used, blood spilt on the floor, stock depleted.Within minutes, the phone rang again. Another trauma patient. And the only place to put them was in the same bay, the other 8 bays were full of other sick patients.This patient was, if anything, more critical. Again requiring a blood transfusion, again needing the 'team approach' . The anaesthetists intubated (put a breathing tube down) the patient, with the help of the nursing staff.Another patient to surgery. Another mess to clear up.We spent another couple of hours trying to orientate the new staff. Then they were left to their own devices.Before the day was out, they had helped with two cardiac arrests (performing cardiac massage), stocked Resus, transferred patients to the wards, taken handovers from the paramedics, started fluids, given medication, performed investigations and cared for the patients.(Never underestimate the power of a cup of tea)As a team, we also dealt with relatives, broke bad news, liaised with other hospital departments.Meanwhile, our colleagues were suturing cut fingers, applying bandages and giving advice (no, you don't need to come to ED with earache you've had for a week!)12.5 hours, a half hour unpaid break. No better job in the world.
