For client focused personnel, the work is 24/7. Literally either with or taking conference calls with current and potential investors 24/7. For strategy focused personnel (eg. quant funds) they also work around the clock refining theories and strategies as a close knit team. They also have a funnel of strategies. They are testing new strategies and watching mature strategies trade in real-time as market behavior changes. They could be working 20-100 hours a week depending on how hot or cold a streak it is. There are so many variables it is hard to put together just a typical day. It is probably not dissimilar to most companies, you're either working on improving your product, or communicating your products to new or existing customers. There is nothing special about the hedge fund business, except that customers are probably a lot more cautious (it is money after all in a post-Madoff world). Also the product you're refining is very competitive when you're trying to build an edge in the most competitive industry in the world with collectively the most amount of smarts and resources behind them. The best part is working with smart people with measurably outcomes. The hardest part (truthfully) is dealing with "potential investors" who for example demand to see all your algorithms before they invest, or want to pay zero fees, or 25 years of track record, etc. You can service them all you like but fundamentally they're just talking to you to validate to themself their existing portfolio which is usually returning <10% pa.
