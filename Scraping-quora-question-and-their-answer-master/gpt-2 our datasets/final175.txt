I am obligated to answer any and all A2As from Aster now, so, here it goes.I jolt awake, my head pounding with a constant headache that never goes away. My room is dark, with only a little light coming through the window on my wall.I roll over, checking my alarm clock, it’s red numbers reflecting off the shiny cover of my pocket book copy of the Constitution.It’s way too early to get up.As I watched, the numbers folded into themselves, and another minute passed. My stomach squirmed urgently, and reluctantly, I dragged myself out of bed. Having health issues sucks.The bathroom floor is ice cold, and the air is chilly, piercing through my clothes as I empty what little my stomach contains into the garbage can. This is pretty normal for me, unfortunately. Once finished, I rinse my mouth out and splash cold water on my face in a vain attempt to drive away the sleep and clear my head.I pull a small Dr. Pepper from the small basement fridge, snag a Clif Bar out of the box next to it, and head up the basement stairs. On my way up, I stepped on a toy car that my sister had thrown down the stairs and nearly fell. She’s gonna kill me one of these days, I thought as I opened the gate that we used to try to keep the little ones from going into the basement.I start making myself some hot chocolate, mixing coconut milk and mix together and popping it in the microwave. As it’s warming up, I hear knocking from the second story, and head up the stairs to find that my sister is already awake in her bed.“Hey nonsense. Whatcha doin’ up so early?” I ask her as she smiles back. I pick her up out of her bed before she can climb out, and take her downstairs with me so that she isn’t bugging my parents, who are still trying to sleep.I plop her down in her high chair next to me with some crackers, and sit down to drink my hot chocolate, pulling my kindle out of my pocket. Eating is so boring by itself, I have to be reading or talking or doing something otherwise I go nuts.Unfortunately, I had miscalculated the distance my sister and my mug of hot chocolate, and, like a bolt of lighting, a little hand shot out and grabbed it, yanking it off the table and spilling it all over her arm. Hot chocolate.Great. Just great, I thought, as I quickly dragged her over to the sink and put her arm under cool water. More angry than hurt, she blames me of course, which is reasonable I suppose as I should have known better than to leave the mug so close to her.I stick her back in her chair once I’m sure that she’s alright, and finish cleaning up all the chocolate all over the floor. I try feeding her some apple sauce, but she isn’t having any of it, not even when I try to play the airplane game with her. I tried making it look cool and delicious by eating some of it myself, but somehow that turned into her trying to feed me and the two of us laughing our heads off… I don’t think any of the apple sauce actually made it into her mouth.I do a few odd jobs, like unloading the dishes and wiping up all the random puddles on the floor that I keep stepping in. There is nothing that I hate more than when the counters are wet or the floor is wet, and I take extraordinary care never to spill water, yet there’s always giant puddles on the floor and my socks are constantly soaked. It’s the worst.My dad comes down to take over a little later, and I take my newly made cup of hot chocolate back downstairs with me, like I had intended to in the first place. I boot up my computer and water my plants, check my Email, and find that I’ve got some 10 new emails from the various pro-life groups like, CareNet and Life Dynamics, and their associated writers and blogs. LifeNews and other groups have been having serious problems with their fundraising campaigns lately, unfortunately. I’ve got a little extra cash on hand right now, and I’ve been debating whether or not I want to shell out $40 for a one year NRA membership term, or if I want to donate that to pro-life groups.My younger cousin wants me to email him about how to install a lord of the rings Minecraft mod. I detail how to install forge and the mod, and gave him the name of one of my favorite servers. I’ve got an email from another cousin of mine who is on his mission. He sends me and the rest of my family weekly updates on what’s been going on, and they are always hilarious. I read through his email eagerly, only wishing it was longer.I check the news. Trump expelled another 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States and closed the Russian Consulate in response to their nerve agent attack on the ex-spy in Britain. More nationwide school walkouts are being organized to protest abortion. Democrats continue to refuse to allow conformation votes on a number of critical appointments. Nothing super eye catching.I open up Quora and look through my notifications. Couple of comments, some upvotes, some A2As, and a few new followers. Some are uplifting comments and praise, some are replies to comments in debates I’m engaged in, a few are comments disparaging me because of my age and telling me that I should be marching with other students in favor of gun control.I reply to a handful, and spend a few minutes working on a couple of answers. I don’t finish either of them, but instead leave them sitting in my drafts for further work later.I log into Minecraft and join my favorite Lord of the Rings server I was in the over world trying to trade with some villagers to get Ender eyes for Ender chests, because I’m heading to Utumno soon and getting out can be tricky.A massive number of mobs ends up invading the village and killing most of the villagers. I managed to clear most of them out, but there are so many of them it was just absurd.(i made dis.)Only a few villagers survived the attack, the ones that I had stuck in safe places for trading later. I finished up there, and returned to Middle Earth, only to find a bunch of evil players were outside my base demanding that I fight them and their armies. I told them, “Come at me with all you have, and I will cut you all down.”Anyway, after a while I got bored and went back to Quora. Answered a few more comments, worked a bit more on an answer, read some people’s stuff, etc. Make myself a burrito and eat it for lunch.I spend a little while working on some home work. My schooling situation is rather complicated, but I have all this math I’m supposed to do. I hate math. Least favorite subject in my opinion, which is funny because I want to go into a career in engineering.My little brother comes down and I let him play Legos in my room. We can’t have them upstairs because my sister tries to eat them if you are not watching her. She’s too old for that, but she thinks it’s a game to stick them in her mouth. I play with him for a little while, building a massive Lego space ship crewed by clone troopers and pirates.My uncle texts me to ask if I want to go on a bike ride today. He and the rest of my family got together last Christmas and bought me an electric bike, which I absolutely love.I went out for a short ride with him. It struggles a bit on hills, but on flat surfaces and when going downhill, the bike is capable of reaching ludicrous speeds. There’s a couple of other younger kids that ride their bikes around most days near my house, and they always try to race me.I come back from my ride exhausted, and log back into Quora. I groan in irritation over someone’s comment telling me that it is simply impossible for a teacher with a handgun to stop a shooter with an AR-15 because the AR-15 fires bullets at higher velocities. Ugh.I eat dinner with my family, log back into Minecraft for a bit, watch a few videos on Youtube, and go up to help put the kids into bed. It was a nightmare. My sister gets awful headaches, perhaps from her medicine we think, and it makes it hard to get her to sleep. My brother was supremely uncooperative, and apparently sleeping isn’t appealing to anyone but me. We get them in bed eventually however.My dad fell asleep with the kids, and me and my mom sat down on the couch and watched an episode of Stargate SG-1, the one where Jack and Teal’c are stuck in a time loop and Jack starts going a little nuts.After the episode, I take a shower, change my clothes, brush my teeth, and get into bed. I read for a bit, then turn off the lamp and plunge my room into darkness once again.It was a pretty boring day on the whole.
