Have a heck of a lot of fun - that's for sure! In answer to the question, I can tell you what I've done: As a climate physicist, I ran Monte Carlo simulations and optimized code. Running simulations can be frustrating and boring but depending on your optimizing skills and software, you can get some pretty good output. Even if this output is  not good, the process still drives you to all kinds of great intuitive insights and thoughts about your work.  Applying Chaos theory and statistics to Solar cycles, paleo-temperature data, and solar flares, I ran statistical simulations as well as data analysis. .
