I have her bedside alarm set for 9:00 and again at 9:30 and mostly she wakes up by then. She lays in bed talking to her cats for at least an hour “trying to get up.”She dresses herself and makes her own breakfast (she NEEDS to do this, she NEEDS to feel somewhat independent, just as she needs her little chores to feel she’s contributing to the house work.)She goes to her recliner in the living room and rereads the paper, checks her phone calls, maybe phones some relatives.She may turn on the tv or not, but she falls asleep for at least an hour. She may or may not go to the bathroom during this time.Then around 1:30 or 2 she or I will make something to eat that she’ll have in her recliner. She gets today’s paper and the mail to go through until early evening for the local news.From local news to the latest about Trump, to the game shows and finally HER shows. I bring her dinner on a tray sometime in there and there’s also another nap.Then it’s the evening news and finally Jimmy Kimmel…can’t go to bed without Jimmy Kimmel.Then she sits in the quiet at least an hour, sometimes more. She sometimes gets a great ambition to do something before bed that never goes right. She’s tired, can’t see well, drops everything and gets cranky…Then she’s off to her room spending an hour getting ready for bed and giving treats to her cats.It sounds pretty boring but it’s really amazing how much she does for herself. She’s 93 years old!CharlotteEDIT: Thank you all for the kind comments and upvotes! Yes, my mom and I are fortunate to have each other and we make a fine pair.I often worry that I’m not necessarily doing the best for her. I’m prolonging her life but not adding any substance to her days.She would not be so housebound but we don’t have a car. I go on foot with a small shopping cart for small batches of groceries.As far as taking her walking, she’s weak and declines invitations to take a walk. It’s a shame because she needs to build up her stamina, as well as leg strength.I am amazed every day how elusive time can be. It seems we should be able to adhere to some kind of schedule, but between the 2 of us slow people and our ‘rests’ between activities, days go by with nothing to show for it.If she needs help getting up, she won’t let me help her. She won’t lean on me and put her weight on me. She insists I call for help. It’s true, if I were to hurt myself trying to lift her, we’d be in a real pickle.So we avoid accidents by adhering to a ‘safety first’ policy which I stick to firmly. She’s learned she can’t get past me on this: no worrying about electricity when it comes to lighting her path, no unnecessary furniture to walk around, no piles of clutter to trip on.But ya! She’s a vital old lady in her prime of old age, lol, and yes, you are right: I’m privileged to get to spend this time with her. Since I wouldn’t want anyone else doing it, I have to do it myself!Thank you again for your positive comments. I read them to her and she was tickled by them. Maybe you all will have motivated her.
