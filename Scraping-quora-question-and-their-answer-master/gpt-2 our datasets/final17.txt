In general, there are three types of physicists. a) Theoretician; b) Experimentalist; c) Educator. I have practiced all three forms (in reverse order) and I would like to describe an average day in each one:Educator: wake up very early (5:30 AM). Shower, dress paying attention to outfit, making sure it shows respect to my charges (students/cadets/future teachers); drive to school while mentally planning the lab for the day. Once at school, check email, check notes from superiors, check list on door for anyone who has signed up for extra help, check folder that is labeled “special questions/challenge questions”; listen to weather report (a must if the topic for the day is electricity and/or thermodynamics) and prepare the lab for the first experiment of the day. Have meaningful dialog with colleagues (my favorite activity) discussing the latest in physics; choose relevant videos on U-Tube and USC and other colleges/universities; finish grading papers (most probably fell asleep while grading the night before), if lucky; have TA do the grading; and finally teach. Hope to hear some thoughtful & intelligent comments from students. Carry out lab experiments and then attend to extra help. Most probably most students would ask for help in calculus. OK with that; since understanding calculus gives them greater understanding in physics. Afterwards, wolf down a sandwich and head to night school to prepare future physics teachers for careers in teaching physics. Rush home, kiss wife and perhaps start grading papers while watching an episode of “Big Bang Theory” or “Quantum Leap”. Fall asleep on couch with red pen falling out of hand. Repeat process the next day.Experimentalist: choose a topic of interest. Assign timeline for carrying out experiments to validate hypothesis. Is three years enough? Perhaps four? Find out previously done experiments on my chosen topic. Search earnestly for funding. As luck would have it, the US dept. of energy has some money lying around. They offer to fund me. Work 70 hours a week trying to discover some evidence of truth for my hypothesis. Three-and-half years later, I hit a dead-end. I decide to choose another worthy research project. Too late. DOE has run out of cash. I resort to theoretical physics.Theoretician: I list three or four topics on which I want to theorize. Read extensively on all topics and start researching if others have done it before. I find that all four have been done by others. I choose an esoteric and “outre” topic. Do extensive research on it. Formally establish a hypothesis and continue showing evidence to support its validity. become the laughing stock of the elite echelons of physics for being so bold in predicting a seemingly ridiculous result. I stick to my gins, write a book about it. The book is praised by the finest of the physics world (a minority) and it is panned by the majority, but more ignorant of the rank and file of physicists. I ask the ultimate question: is all this heartache worth it? Without answering, I return to teaching.
