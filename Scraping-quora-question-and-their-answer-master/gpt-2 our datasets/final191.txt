11 AM  Get up. Have hair of the dog. Have another hair of the dog. Then have a whole dog.3 PM wake up with hangover. Curse bitterly and take an aspirin. Slouch over to typewriter. Sit down and try to write anything worth a damn.5 PM  Stare at blank page and try to come up with brilliant ideas. Hunger intrudes. Get up and go make lunch. After lunch, lie down and snooze.7:30 PM Wake up with ideas from your dreams. Pound the keys capturing them. Stop and reread, exclaim, 'this is all crap' and tear up the sheets. Now you remember Hemingway's dictum:  "Find one good truth and write it." After pondering, you come up with one and you put it on paper in decent form.2 AM  You realize you've been writing for hours and accomplished a lot.  Now you need to unwind so you can sleep.  Amble into kitchen, make a drink, ah, that was good. Make another drink. Sometime later you stop making drinks because the bottle is empty. and the liquor store is closed. You stumble to the bedroom and collapse across the bed.6 AM  Phone rings.  Cursing, you pick it up and roundly denounce the caller.  It's someone with an undecipherable accent, but you catch the word "Pulitzer...'  You snarl "Mail it!" and drop the phone and collapse again on the bed. Life is good.
