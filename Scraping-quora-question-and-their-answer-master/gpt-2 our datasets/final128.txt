As soon as I wake up, I run to my portraits of Lenin and Marx and spend an hour praying that they will give me the courage to spread Communism.When I'm finished with that, I eat breakfast-avocado toast and a soy milk low-fat fair trade, ethically sourced, cruelty-free vegan latte with extra foam.Afterwards, I work on a new post about how all white cishet Christian scum I mean men should die for my feminist Tumblr blog.After lunch (quinoa salad if you wanted to know), I head into town and wander around looking for random black people to pay reparations to. If I see any white men, I make certain to stop and explain to them how they oppress all women and minorities with their mere existence. Then I punch them, because all white men are Nazis. Of course, I must then go to the nearest safe space because all interactions with those filthy oppressors trigger me.Finally, in the evening I meet up with the local Antifa and we go out to smash the fash.Rinse and repeat.
