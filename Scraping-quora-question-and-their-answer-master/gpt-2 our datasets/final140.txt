My elderly parents (89) still live in their own home. Dad has capacity, but is physically frail. Mom has dementia, but physically better than Dad. I live 2 doors down.Dad gets up usually early, by 7am & earlier if his body hurts to much to stay in bed. He uses a walker especially first thing in the morning. The morning hours are his favorite time. He eats his cereal, reads the paper. Works on what ever his current interest is, right now it’s the Hebrew language as it pertains to the Bible. Sometimes he rides his stationary bike when his body will allow it.Mom wanders out about 9 or 930, she is confused about things , she asks repetitive questions, my dad reassures her and patiently answers. She eats her cereal, Dad helps because Mom can’t remember where we keep the bowls or spoons anymore. Mom lays down again after breakfast.While mom naps Dad goes on errands, but not too long, if she wakes up and can’t find him she gets anxious. sometimes he putters in his yard (and mine). He falls sometimes.Dads home by lunchtime & Wakes mom up. They fix sandwiches, or go out to eat if mom feels like it. After lunch Dad uses his cane to walk down to my house & he gets my little dog & keeps her at his house till I get off work. After that every one naps till I’m home from work by 4pm.My dad does have a smart phone, we text back & forth during the day. He also has a computer & Amazon prime, he orders stuff a lot.My parents and I have supper together every night between 530 & 6pm. My mom can’t help with meals anymore so dad & I are trying to keep our menu choices smart.They watch Lester Holt on the news, then wheel of fortune and Jeopardy. After that my dad reads, because my mom can’t keep up with plot lines on tv due to having no short term memory.Often my dad is awakened by mom , late at night, she says “ Is this our house? Does Robin live here? “ . Dad reassures her.They go to bed about 11pm
