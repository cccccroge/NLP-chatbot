When i was in a relationship with him, i thought i am not alone, but now when i think of him and the relationship we have i am seeing that i was never ever alone that much in my entire life.On sunday mornings when we woke up, he had never spoken he took his phone into his hand and he read every piece of shit that he could find just to ignore me. And then the breakfast subject comes up, where to eat? If i suggested him we can breakfast at home if he wants he starts to saying things like it is so hard to be woth you. You dont want to do anything i dont want to stay at .After deciding where to go and he was able to critisize everything. When you had enough of critizing he was begining to saying things like” you are always like this, look at your face, you are not able to satisfy woth anything” ( i am really proud of myself now, when i think of those things i have gone through, i have gone through hell i guess)Ohhh the special days like my birthday etc. He was trying his best not to spend his time woth me. On my last birthday before we broke up i stayed home in a city where i dont have friends, my birthday is on 1 st of june and he took me to birthday dinner on 3rd of june. First he said that he forgotten and the next day he choose to go to a gym . And he took me to dinner to a restaurant which he was wanted to go.When i was trying to talk about the things in my lofe and problems he shut down himself with saying “ ahh i am getting bored shut up i dont wanna hear it you are always complaining” and if i were trying to explain myself he was starting to swear or saying that i am insecure and all kinds of things.And when i try to leave him, baammm the honeymoon was starting just for an hour.I had and i still have struggling woth stockholm syndrome. It was so hard to let go and even though i know what the devil he exactly he is. I let the devil to destroy me for 6 years.Those were the days my friend. Like a hell, like a nightmare, like a worst dream i can think of.
