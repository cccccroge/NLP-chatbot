I get up at 5 AM, say some encouraging Bible verses to myself, such as “The Lord is my Shepherd. I shall not want”, “The Lord is my light and my Salvation. Who shall I fear, of whom shall I be afraid” or “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”. After attending to my morning toilette, I go to the kitchen and turn my laptop on to listen to Rachel Maddow and later to MSNBC live, while I eat a bowl of my homemade granola, eat a piece of fair trade, dark 85% cocoa chocolate, and some fruit. Then I look at my emails and then at Facebook. Then it’s time to do my husband’s breakfast. We are retired elderly people.What I do next depends what day of the week it is. Monday is housecleaning day. On other week days, I do some form of exercise. I particularly like walking in the forest. My husband prefers to go to the gym (something I do not do). At noon my husband and I go out to lunch, in the afternoon, I practice organ, piano, and singing. At 4PM I prepare to cook dinner, which I serve at 5PM. Then I talk to my granddaughter. And after that, I usually go to bed, unless it’s Wednesday, when I go to choir practice. On Fridays we get groceries. On Sundays, I sing alto in the church choir or I substitute for organists in other churches.When it is election year, be it mid-terms or presidential elections, I make sure I go to vote.Thank you.
