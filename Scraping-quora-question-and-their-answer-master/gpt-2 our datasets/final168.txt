Well, I wake up early in the morning because I gotta feed my horses and take them around the ranch. Farm ain’t gonna run itself sonny. I roll out of bed and push aside the Confederate flag blanket. Before I go anywhere, I gotta pay my respects to the portraits of Reagan, Bush, and Trump. After sacrificing a few endangered animals to their shrines, I go to brush my teeth. No shaving for me, gotta keep my neckbeard. I get dressed in a plaid shirt, jeans, cowboy boots with spurs, and fedora.After this, I kiss my AR-15 with bump stock and load a full clip of ammo into the gun. Gotta protect myself against rabid liberals like SJWs and Antifa. Along the way I shove a Colt .45 into my belt, give my blonde wife a kiss, say goodbye to my twenty children, then head out the door. I shove a big fat cuban cigar into my mouth and blow smoke in a protester woman’s face as she starts complaining about my male privilege.After my farm routines, I drive my diesel-burning smokestack truck around town to buy a few more guns. Behind me are a horde of militant environmental protestors, who are chasing me in a Prius. I rev the engine and blow thick, black, smoke, into their visage. Ah, nothing like the smell of burnt rubber and putrid smoke in the morning.Oops, along the way it looks like I ran over a few illegal immigrants trying to cross the border. But oh well, fewer people we need to deport back anyways.I arrive at my day job, the coal mine. I gear up. I yell at the minorities who look like they are hard at work. They are plotting to steal my job! Gotta oppress them. Thank Trump, the only person who will kick those scum back to the gutter where they came from.After my job, I walk hand in hand with a few other conservative chums. Looks like there are Hillary supporters protesting outside our mine, so we take our AR-15s and massacre the protestors.We go to our local KKK rally, where we keep tallies of how many protestors we shot this month. Looks like I am in 3rd place this month. Dammit Elijah Smith, he’s been in first place for four consecutive months!Then drive to the bar to celebrate. Along the way I run over a few alligators. Oops. Maybe I can make some alligator hide boots for my wife.At the bar we get roaring drunk, and harass a few underage waitresses. They seem to be enjoying it. I hear that Rocket Man made some more provocative statements. Drop a few nukes on his ass, that should shut him up for good.Once I get home, my wife has already put the kids to bed and cleaned the house and washed my clothes and cooked dinner. I enjoy my kangaroo steak made from the rarest species of endangered kangaroo known to mankind. Side dishes are some deer I shot earlier in the week. All washed down with some more beer. After, I get a call from the principal saying my kid went to school and shot up a few people today. No big deal. Got a call a few days ago saying my kid’s best friend shot up a few people too.I prepare for bed. No showering for me, that is my monthly ritual! Before I sleep, I kneel onto the ground and pray to our Lord Jesus Christ about the horrid state of America, with her migrants, liberals, gays, and other miscreants.And with that, after a hard day’s work, I fall into a deep sleep, wrapping myself in my Confederate flag blanket. Gosh, this is tiring.GOD BLESS MURICA
