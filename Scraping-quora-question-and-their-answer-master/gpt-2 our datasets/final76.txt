Wake up at 7:55. Argue over 'is it worth attending the first lecture' with yourself. Decide it's not. Sleep again.Wake again at 9:20, 10 mins to end of breakfast serving....get up and rush to mess. Have breakfast.Get back to room. Again argue over starting DC. Open DC. Waste time on main chat. Download some useless stuff. Again waste time on it for two hrs.Contemplate over 12 o clock tutorial. Then take it Lite. Open FIFA. Play for 10 mins but it's magically 2 o clock.Half an hr before lunch closes. Rush to mess. Realise it's Friday and the lunch is still shit. Get a coke and maggi and get back to room.Classes from 3 to 5. Attend any one (rarely both) because cg is 'gg' and you need to save it.Talk on useless topics with friends and get back to room.Realise it's college, you need to have a hobby. Go out to play.Go to football field, realise maybe you dont belong here.Go to cricket field, nopes....not here either.Badminton, tennis, chess, TT.....no no no.Come back to room. Open DC. Download a movie. Start watching.It's 9 o clock and half hr before dinner closes. Rush to mess. See the menu. 'Butter Chicken'...close eyes. Peace.Get back to room, open DC ...maybe a little more time waste. Maybe start a TV show episode. Possibly FRIENDS. But uh oh.....it's 3 am suddenly. Need to get your shit together and sleep.Lay on the bed. Promise over waking up early next morning, jogging, bathing blah blah blah....sleep. life still 'gg'. LITE.Repeat.PS. It's at Goa. Dont know about Pilani or Hyderabad.
