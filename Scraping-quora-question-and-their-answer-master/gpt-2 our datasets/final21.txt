Theoretical physicists are one of the most beautiful people I have ever seen in my life. Being a theoretical physicist is also a good feeling. I am at my initial phase of Integrated Phd in Physics. It will take a lot of time to be called a professional one, may be about 5-6 years.A day in the life of Physicists is quite fascinating one. Being away from pain and boredom, theoretical physicists start their day with a great sip of coffee, as I do. Then,Â  focus on the last night problems that exhausted us and led us to sleep. Still not finding the solution, we focus on other topics, one that can charge us to be fascinated instead of make us feel trapped or boring. After 4-5 hours of imagination, we find ourselves hungry, which was actually not there at the time of imagining things. After consuming ample food, we take a walk with our mind still brooding over the idea and imagining things. Lately, when we find we are getting nowhere, we let that thing free and wait for the correct solution of the problem. Yes, we have patience and perseverance and we wait for the correct time getting us out of the problem. This is how our day is spent. I do not know about others but at least mine goes in such a way. It is not a surprise that theoretical physicists love to live alone. When imagination is giving us happiness, why there is a need for temporary people?Theoretical Physicists rock.
