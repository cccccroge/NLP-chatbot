I wake up, and I decide to try this morning meditation thing that I’ve seen my liberal relatives on social media posting about. I sit for 3.5 minutes, and then realize that the verbal root of the word “conservative” is “to conserve”. The pit of my stomach drops. Here comes the rabbit hole.What am I trying to conserve? Is it the time when human beings could legally own each other, or at least keep people with more melanin from drinking from my people’s drinking fountain? Is it the time when nonconformists around gender and sexuality could be fired, evicted, and beaten to death without society noticing or caring? Is it the time when women and children knew their place and kept to it? When were the actual “good old days”?Or is it a set of values? Which values are better? Family values? What does that even mean? Does that mean that families are better or somehow more legitimate than single people? Does it mean that you should always stick with your family, even if they’re abusive or don’t support you in your hopes and dreams? Does it mean forcing someone to have a family if they’ve started a pregnancy that they’re not prepared to finish?I don’t like these questions. I don’t like this meditation thing. It’s a liberal trick. I don’t feel calmer or happier at all. Screw this, I’m going for coffee and donuts. I hope the rest of my day is better than that was!
