I’m Canadian, so on a typical day I try to enjoy lots of entitlements like affordable education and health care. Sometimes I’m not even sick. I go to the doctor just in case. I love the idea of really hard working people, salt of the earth types, toiling away in coal mines and farms, so that their tax dollars can be wasted on my ungrateful ass. Still, I aspire to one day illegally immigrate to the US to steal a coal mining job from a hard working American, my way of giving something back.On a day when I have some free time I’ll go and see movies with a Liberal agenda. Have you seen Black Panther? Sooo much representation! That new Ghostbusters movie with all women Ghostbusters? I like it better than the original and anyone who doesn’t is racist! I watch the new Star Wars movies again and again because it paints white men in such a negative light. Ever notice how all the white men in those movies are… not good? And Rey’s super good at everything? Perfect! I love me some feminazi propaganda.Speaking of propaganda, I’m all about Fake News. Every day I’ll watch the Young Turks, CNN, NBC (Rachel Maddow is my jam!) and then disseminate said Fake News all over the internet just to baffle conservatives. Sometimes I spread Fake News by omission. Why am I always talking about Mueller’s investigation of Trump when Obama and Killary have done some shit too? Bias, that’s why.Politically, I’m very correct. I say “Happy Holidays” instead of “Merry Christmas”. I’m pro-choice because I really hate babies. I never talk about black on black crime, preferring to hold police to a higher standard than black on black criminals. I dabble in “Alt left” terrorism. For example, if I ever hear the national anthem, I do what all black on black people do and fall to one knee, a gesture seething with contempt for the military. I’m a snowflake who actively seeks the things that offend me so I can melt every time Trump tweets mean things about minorities, only to re-crystalize and melt once more when I read a mean comment on the internet. It’s probably the only reason I’m on Quora.
