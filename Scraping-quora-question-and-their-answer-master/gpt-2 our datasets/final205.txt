As a software engineer, I'll give you my take:I typically roll into work about 8 am, which is about an hour earlier (or more) than about 70% of my team. I take that time to check email and make sure I don't have any interviews or prep-necessary meetings before noon. About 9, we have our standup. When I first started, these felt wasteful, but as my contributions touched more teams (and  I gained more understanding of our code) I find I often have context to add to most peoples' updates or relevant blockers to be aware of. I then spend some time  unblocking items that came up during the stand up or code reviews. Rarely will I delve into coding at this point. Sometimes we'll also have sprint planning (2 hours) or quarterly planning (8 hours) that starts at this time. If I have no meetings, no plannings, no blockers and no interviews, I will pair with another developer to start work on a bug or a feature. If it is a bug, we usually find the problem in minutes, but then spend a couple hours chasing down "why" it was introduced or what malformed product decision came to this bug existing. If it is a feature, we have to get context around what currently exists. Often it's completely unextensible, so then we have to make a decision to do some heavy refactoring or green field develop. The answer is usually driven by the amount of existing test code that is in place. Regardless of which step we take, we find that the prior planned effort points we assigned to the task were woefully low. I take lunch at 11. I don't eat breakfast because I'm 32, and my body sucks at processing more than 1500 calories a day worth of food, especially because I spend most of the day on my ass in a comfy chair. If I wait til 12, I start getting cranky and hangry with my peer coding partner. Many people schedule brown bag presentations and meetings. I don't like these people, and I definitely don't go to their meetings. I don't think  many things in life are sacred, but lunch is. After lunch, my day tends to be far more open, and I usually can focus on the task I'd started in the morning, or start the task I'd wanted to start in the morning. Occasionally we will have another subgroup meeting or I will have a 1:1 with my boss. Those are typically weekly. Around 4 I will intend to leave to head home and spend a little time with my wife who works an opposite schedule of me, but will almost invariably be stopped by a coworker who will need me to aide them with a code review or to assist with some archaic process we've employed. That will typically keep me around for another hour and then I'll be able to head home. After my wife goes to bed around 7 or 8, I will log back on to my work email only to find that someone can't build the app because a contributor to one of the many dozens of libraries we employ on our app decided that one of their dependencies was just too old, updated it and it broke our entire build chain. I'll spend about 2 more hours fixing that, then  watch episodes of Top Gear that I pirated and then head to bed to sleep, which is also a gamble because my brain is now ionized and recharged by the new challenge and I find it difficult to fall asleep at that point.
