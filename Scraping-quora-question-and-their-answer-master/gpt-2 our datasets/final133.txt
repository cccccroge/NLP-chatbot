My 85 year old father and I live together. My father has never gotten the memo about being “retired”. He is awake and up by 6-6:30 am. This year I did purchase a special alarm clock for him. It wakes him with light not sound. My father has worn 2 hearing aids for most of my life time. He is pretty much deaf without them. His hearing has declined greatly these past two years. When he has an early appointment he uses his alarm.We watch the news during breakfast. My father fixes his own breakfast every day: omelets, scrambled eggs, french toast, bacon or sausage are usually what he prepares. He feeds my dog. He turns on all my plant lights and when the sun is up he'll open the curtains. He takes out the trash and recycling. He breaks down any shipping boxes that have arrived and puts them in recycling. He will have a second cup of coffee and read for about an hour on his tablet or from a book (he prefers books). He'll decide on dinner for us and update the shopping list. He'll either head to the grocery store or mow the lawn if it's needed.He does the edging and weed eating too. My father's philosophy has always been “Use it or lose it". If a person sits around doing nothing pretty soon that is all they will be able to do. I work full time five days a week. I am usually gone before he heads to the store or the yard. He will have made me a salad for my lunch on most days. He'll grill chicken breast for me to add to my lunch time salads about once a week. After he grills the chicken (charcoal grill outside) he cubes up the meat, places it is serving sizes and puts all the bags in the freezer. My father is constantly worried that I don't eat enough protein. He doesn't want me skipping lunch or worse, buying lunch out.Sometimes he'll walk my dog. Sometimes he'll take him with him as he drives quick errands to the bank or the dry cleaners. He worries my dog might get bored. My father always has projects. He never had hobbies or an interest in sports (except the Olympics). He changes the oil in his car. He does all his own car maintenance. He still drives like a champ. He backs into the driveway every day without issue. He repairs things, furniture, small electronics most anything.He will get on his computer and email a couple of friends. He'll check his investments, he'll talk to his broker or balance his accounts. General book keeping. He might play a game of solitaire on the computer for 20-30 minutes. He reads news and research articles. He'll text with my siblings. I have 4.He keeps an eye on the neighbors. He frequently helps them. They come to him for advice or to borrow tools. He picks up their mail if they are away. They see him outside using the pressure washer, pulling weeds, cleaning the rain gutters, up on the roof… Yes, he scares me. Yes, I'm concerned. But there is no way I am going to stop him from living. He takes zero prescriptions. Only supplements.He is slowing down. He takes more cat-naps these days. But needless to say his life is quite full and active at this point. I thank God I still have him around. This has been our routine for the past 10 years since my mother has passed.
