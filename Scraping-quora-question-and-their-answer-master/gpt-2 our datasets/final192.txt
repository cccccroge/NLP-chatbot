TBH it’s very, very boring.My “day” begins at around 4 PM local time, when my alarm goes off. I write at night because there are fewer interruptions then.I feed the birds, check my email, answer a couple Quora questions, and go to work. I work until a need a brief break, recheck email, answer Quora questions, or possibly play a half hour of a video game (Fallout: New Vegas at the moment). I generally have a bird with me while I work, because they each get out/playtime. At midnight Larry and I watch some TV together over dinner and birds (we each have one) and I go back to work until about 7 AM, when I let the peafowl out and go to bed.
