On normal days, I design algorithms and write codes. Algorithms and codes, which if mistreat even a single data-bit will create hullabaloo in the entire country. In my line of work (scientist at ISRO), a single bit goes wrong and we would be bidding our dear satellite a good-bye.Other than that, daily routine includes keeping my novels away from my bosses sight. The simulations run for hours and it takes days to debug something. Meanwhile I prefer to read novels which, I think, my boss doesn’t like (judging by his expressions when he caught me once :P ).A normal day also includes riding the ‘vehicle of death’. Driving a 2 wheeler on the roads of Bangalore is nothing less than waving hi to a hungry lion, you might have a chance that the lion is vegetarian (got my point?).
