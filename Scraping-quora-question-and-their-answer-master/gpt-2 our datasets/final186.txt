Short answer: A lot like yours.I'm a southern liberal. I support socialism. I voted for Sanders.And I'm offended that you have to ask this question. I cannot fathom how this could be asked seriously unless you are:young and live in a dark blue area/familyTrying to troll or inciteIf the former: go ahead and get it in your head now. Conservatives are people. Regular people. And the vast majority of them are just trying to do what they think is best for themselves and their loved ones. Just like any liberals you know. Most are not malicious. And you should never, ever, judge a group of people as a unit. The reality is always going to be more complex.If the latter: you're absolutely disgusting. I don't care which camp you fall in or what your motives are. We're divided enough already. We need to bridge the gap in our political differences. Even if this was asked in ignorance, learn to think about the consequences of your actions. It's hard enough to have a legitimate conversation with people already. The US has been demoted on the global democracy index to a flawed democracy.I have a three year old daughter, and her freedoms may be at stake if we can't start getting everybody to the table again.
