I wake up at 6:30 each day. After breakfast and commute(10 minutes) the office sees me in at between 8 and 9.I spend too much time reading up on articles and news and tweets and lately Quora, which makes me waste almost 3 hours on it.Then it's time for lunch and after that it's time for coding. That happens until 6pm, when I head out home, most likely not taking the work with me.My problem is efficiency: I spend too much time scouring the web. Although, some of the web surfing is work, I can convince myself that the time is spent well. Despite that, I still get 6 hours of solid coding a day, which it seems to me is quite low.While at home, I spent too much time investigating issues and topics that I need on the iPad, which adds up to the slow surfing total of the day.I try to have a balanced family life, including wife.I think that GTD and the Flow methodology helps me tremendously in getting the actual work done.
