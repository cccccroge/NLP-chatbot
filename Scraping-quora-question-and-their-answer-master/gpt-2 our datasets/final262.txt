My favorite part of each day is when I’m working on combat sports. I am learning boxing, muay thai, and jiu jitsu, and all of them are crazy fun! I get to punch, kick, and fold people! Many people who see me are surprised because I’m in my 60s. I get up super early each morning to get to boxing class at 6 AM. Then later in the day come muay thai and jiu jitsu! It’s like magic!
