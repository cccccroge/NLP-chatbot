Alarm goes off and I wake up.Order my wife to get my coffee to the patio. NOW!Command her to make my breakfast, and the eggs better be exactly the way I like them.Receive breakfast but wife hasn’t put on her makeup yet so I take my breakfast and throw it on the patio. Tell her to clean it up, fix it again and get her makeup on before she serves me a new breakfast.While waiting, I put on my MAGA ball cap, walk outside in my I HATE HILLARY boxers and steal my Nextdoor neighbor’s morning paper. It’s OK. She moved here from California.Go back to the patio with MY paper and scream for my breakfast. Wife brings new breakfast with makeup this time. (What was she thinking?)I go to my gun safe and count my guns. Strap on my concealed carry and wait for the neighbor kids to walk to the bus.See them coming, step out of the house and yell “stay off my grass!” One of the moms call me a monster, so I draw my weapon with one hand and turn on the sprinklers with the other. Heh heh heh, that’ll shut her up. Stupid liberal.I watch my my neighbor across the street (he’s an orthopedic surgeon) go to work. Now his wife goes to work, she too is a doctor. However, she’s Puerto Rican. Ya whatever. I call ICE and give them her tag number and tell them to do something about it.The black couple from around the corner walk by on MY sidewalk. I call the police and report the suspicious activity. I put my hand on the gun and tell them to keep walking.Finally I go to work. Some 22 year old pup has the nerve to ask if he could borrow one of my tools. SMH. I take him aside and lecture him on how responsible I was when I was his age. Tell him I won’t ask to borrow his girlfriend if he won’t ask to borrow my tools.Go to break and have coffee with my work buddies. We discuss and recall the good old days. Break buzzer goes off, we tell the young guys to get back to work. We talk about the good old days for another 15–20 minutes then get back to work.That afternoon I log into my security system and wait for the kids to get back from school. Turn on sprinklers again just as they hit the mid point of my yard. Laugh when one of them drops their backpack in the water.Finally I go back home, go to the bedroom and take off my clothes, leaving them in a pile in the floor to make it easy for my wife to see them and put them in laundry.Wife gets home, I inform her that she needs to get on supper ASAP. I’m hungry. I sit down in the front room and watch Fox News for the next 2 1/2 hours. Wife serves me dinner while I’m watching. Take my plate to the kitchen and let her know I’m done and she can clean the kitchen now.Go back out to the patio and write my daily letter to the editor about the left, liberals, snowflakes, blacks, women, homosexuals, or Mexicans and how they are all ruining this great country.It’s getting late, so I turn down my bed, take off my gun and lock it up, put my earphones in and fall asleep to the sweet podcast voice of Rush Limbaugh.Goodnight Quorans, MAGA!
