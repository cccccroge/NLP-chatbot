The typical life of an Indian conservative is something like this.I get up in the morning at 4:30 AM to Narendra Modi chanting “Jai Shree Ram” (Victory to Lord Ram).Then I brush my teeth and do the usual stuff and set a deep glass of gau mutra (cow’s pee).As I sip my favourite drink, I think about my dream in which all the mosques in India were demolished. A wonderful dream that. After laughing wickedly at that, I head to the place of worship at home.I then begin to worship Narendra Modi, Trump and Putin for about an hour.Then I head to school in a saffron dress on my pushpaka vimaana (flying chariot).At school, I bully all my minority classmates, refuse to listen to teachers who belong to the minority sect and moan that we students are not being thought about Hindutva and Sarvarkar.During lunch I harass all the beef-eaters in my class and force a big bottle of gau mutra down their unholy, un- Indian throats.After school, I head to the nearest RSS shakha (a military organization that grooms Hindu militants) and listen to the head chief and learn new techniques on how to kill and terrorise Muslims, Christians and the low caste people.On coming home, I study the Vedas, Upanishads and most importantly the regressive, patriarchal Hindu laws, especially the Manu Smriti.Then I begin to spread fake news that I have been instructed to propagate by the BJP IT cell. I get 5000 rupees (approx. 78$) for every piece of fake news that I spread.Then I go to bed and dream my wonderful dream.Weekends include fun activities like lynching Muslim cow smugglers and whipping the “lower” caste people and breaking up night club activities.This is the day of an Indian conservative in India.At least, this is what the Left-liberal intelligentsia thinks we do daily.Cheers!
