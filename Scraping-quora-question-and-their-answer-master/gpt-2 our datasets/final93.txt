Background: Investment professional at multi-billion dollar fund but I've worked at small funds too. I cover a few industries but am the go-to person for tech.As already mentioned, no day is typical but here's a representative day at the current gig.TLDR: I read a lot and take plenty of breaks.    Morning: 5:25am: Wake up and skim emails/alerts on my phone. No real work is done here. Just trying to get a sense of what my day may be like.5:45am: If there's nothing pressing (i.e. meeting, call, etc.), I'll spend an hour or so doing non-work related stuff. I might go on a run, long walk, or do an online programming tutorial (trying to learn Python - don't laugh). 6:45am: Head into office.6:45am - 8:00am: Emails, coffee, breakfast,  read misc analyst reports, surf the web, etc.8:00am - Noon: Review my to-do list for the day and make adjustments if necessary. If a stock I've been following moves materially, I'll make it a priority to look at what's going on. I'll also check in with the portfolio manager to see if there's anything he'd like me to work on and/or to get feedback on analysis I'm working on. I'll also check in with my junior analysts and give them feedback on projects we're working on. Beyond that, it's a lot of reading and analysis. Public filings, transcripts, company presentations, data analysis, forecasts, etc.  Most of my best ideas come from reading and not stock screening. I used to do a lot of modeling earlier in my career but I mostly push  that down to junior staff now and focus on more big picture issues. Every hour or so I'll take a sanity break which typically involves visiting tech centric sites. I'm a (wannabe) geek at heart so I love reading all things tech and learning about new start-ups, business models, technology, platforms, etc.  Afternoon: Noon - 7:00pm: More of the same. Read transcripts, gather data, review projects with junior analysts or PM, get on conference calls, etc. I'll  occasionally talk to sell-side analysts but those guys can't keep their  mouth shut and I have to assume the name(s) I'm talking to them about  will leak. I'm usually out of the office by 7pm.Evening:These days I really try to avoid taking my work home but it happens. I nearly burnt out after the 2008 crash and it took a lot of personal reflection to make rebalancing my life a priority (if you consider being home by 8pm life balance lol). My evenings typically include reading industry reports or going to meetups (both online and offline) to learn more about tech but I don't consider that work.
