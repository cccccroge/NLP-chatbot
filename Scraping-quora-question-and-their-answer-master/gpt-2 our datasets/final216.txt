Days were split fairly evenly between in the field and in the office. It would be wonderful if all the good weather days were outside and all the foul weather days were inside, and often it would work that way, but not always.I usually had to take a flight for my last job if it was field work. Flights could take from 3 to 6 hours, if they were in the US. Sometimes a person would meet me at the airport and take me to the job site, and sometimes I had to rent a car. Most of the time it was to review work already done by another or work in progress. After the trip I would write up a report of the findings.The time in the office was spent answering phone calls, writing publications, reviewing articles for journals, and in meetings. Lots of meetings and lots of phone conversations.When I was a field engineer I actually got to design and oversee construction of projects. This was the most satisfying work for me.Hope this gives you some idea of what you might expect, although every position will have a different typical work day.Jim
