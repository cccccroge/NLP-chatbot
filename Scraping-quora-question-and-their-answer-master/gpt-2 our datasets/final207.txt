When I get to work at 8 am, I boot up my computer, check my email, and then talk to my coworkers in my group about the tests that we have to run during that day, and the upcoming tests that we are waiting for parts. If we have tests to run, I go downstairs and start to boot the appropriate computers and setup the test to run. Depending on the test, the setup could only take an hour, but it could also take the whole day. The process repeats itself for each test, and can become a broken record, but then every-so-often, out of the blue, something different comes in - whether it be a different noise that comes out of the HVAC, going to the final assembly plant to listen and fix the new noise, or a car coming into the lab for us to fix. Everyday throws new challenges, so there really is no typical day. For goodness sake, the last three days we have had no tests to run, so I spend all day staring at my computer trying to find something to do (or I go to the game room or a walk around the lake - weather permitting)Generally, I take my lunch around 11:30 am, and then I leave around 4:30 pm.
