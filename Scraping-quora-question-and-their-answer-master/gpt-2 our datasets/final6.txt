I lived there for two years, moved away to buy a house since I didn’t have $2 million in cash lying around to buy one . Here’s the most Silicon Valley day I can think of. I lived in Sunnyvale right between the Apple campus and the Google Sunnyvale campus, Tech Corners.Wake up at 4:30, head over to my High Impact Interval Training Class at my small boutique gym. Half are wearing T-shirts from the tech companies or they work for, parking lot is full of high end cars. Be sure to check in on FB and include a meme about squats and killing your workout.Drive home, get passed by a few Tesla’s, notice there is not one old car on the 85 which runs from south San Jose to Mountain View.Take the dog for a walk, notice everyone is also taking their dog for a walk, because people really love their dogs here. Bonus points if it’s a rescue. Play Pokémon go because the parks are a pretty good spot to get some. Avoid the areas where the regulars are practicing Tai Chi.Get ready for work, knock on my kid’s door to make sure he’s up and ready to go, because even living under 5 miles from school means a half hour car ride. Grab my prepped meals out of the fridge, laptop, and make a latte with my machine. Give hubby a kiss as he sits down in the office to take his first 1:1 meeting online with one of his employees. Running late this morning so my kid and I use our app to order breakfast and pick up on the way there.I drop him off at school, give the rundown if it’s a day I pick him up after school, he hangs out with his friends after, Uber’s home or if stepdad is getting him today, when and where practice is, etc.Drive to work in Palo Alto which takes nearly two hours - I am about 13 miles away so yes, omg. Listen to mindfulness exercises on YouTube so I don’t lose my mind sitting in traffic to get on the freeway, contemplate moving my 9 and 10 am clients so I don’t have to sit in this traffic. There was no accident on the 101 or the 85 so I’m confused. Observe the long lines of cars waiting to get off the freeway in a Mountain View. Take a back road and catch a glimpse of the Google Self Driving Car on El Camino Real.Exit University Avenue in Palo Alto, and relax as I pass the tree lined streets of mansions and observe the work trucks parked, working on renovations, nannies pushing strollers, taking the kids on walks, and more dogs, joggers, and cyclists. Park at my office and get set up. It’s hard to find office space in Palo Alto so I sublet three days a week and keep what I need for the day in a box.See my morning clients, then walk to Hana Haus for another latte at Blue Bottle (beautiful leaf art in my foam!) and a slice of their amazing gluten free carrot loaf. Perhaps I’m walking past a table where the next new thing is being developed.Take a walk around the block and back to the office for the next round of clients.Hubby and I have a few free hours today so I drive to his work for lunch at a very large tech company. Verbalize my jealousy that his company has sit down restaurants, baristas, ice cream, gyms, and everything you’d imagine. Plus he practically doesn’t have to buy clothes because they get hoodies and shirts all the time. Verbalize my gratitude he comes home because if I worked there I’d never leave. Enjoyed a healthy four course meal - crudités, salad, seared duck breast cassoulet and a trio of sorbet.Return to work and see a few more clients for the day, pack up and stop at one of the 3 amazing gelato shops in a two block radius. Today it might be banana creme brûlée with hazelnut butter swirl or something equally mind blowing that you don’t mind paying $6 for.Pick up kid from school, talk about the day and pick up his dinner and snacks and drinks for the baseball game. Escape the city areas and drive into Los Altos, pass by ranches and new and old mansions on the way to the baseball field. Drop off kid at baseball game, find a place to park, door dash dinner for delivery at the field. See a few guys on Segways because it’s Silicon Valley.Dig into some delicious Thai food at the field, although in Los Altos the food at the canteen is pretty awesome too. Hubby joins us and we watch the game. For a moment it feels like we are back in our little town watching baseball again.Turn around see parades of cars of Porsches, Lamborghinis, Vipers, Corvettes, more Teslas Maserati’s, Mercedes G wagons, etc, driving by the baseball field. Finish up baseball game and listen to my son discuss the game. Every now and then he’ll see one of the many mansions and say, I wonder what they do for a living? I wonder too. Glad there’s no shaming or disappointment in how we live.Pull into our 1950’s ranch style house with no insulation and 1950’s heater and AC that is suitable for half the size of the house that we pay over $4500 a month to rent, but it’s a safe clean neighborhood, and it has a yard and a hot tub. Get home and figure out what we’re going to do this weekend, kid wants to go to a convention, might go see the Sharks play, figure out a time for instant cart and google express so I don’t have to spend two hours driving to the stores I need to go to this weekend (traffic, not driving distance), do all my grocery shopping online, arrange for early morning drop off for groceries, pet food, and Target stuff.Watch a show on Netflix, check my calendar for the next day and head to bed.
