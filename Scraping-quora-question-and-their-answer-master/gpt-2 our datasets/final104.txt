I felt like everyday was as serious as competing in the Olympic finals. The seriousness of what was going on, the “OMG!” fear and stress, the “shit hitting the fan” moments happened constantly. And because I was a trader it was all up to me to urgently solve it. This is why people (including myself) burn out. It is a completely unnatural thing to put your mind and life through. For some other employees (analysts) it was much calmer.
