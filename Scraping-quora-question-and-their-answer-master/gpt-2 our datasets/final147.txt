I have no elderly parents, both of mine are deceased. I do live in an over 55 community though and many of my friends are in their 70’s, 80’s and even 90’s.Barring any severe illnesses; I would say my friends have lived very active lives up to (and including) retirement. Certain of my friends no longer wish to drive - so we plan outings where I can drive them and we can get their grocery shopping done, hair cuts and doctor visits accomplished.The majority of my “elderly friends” spend a part of their week volunteering (i.e. at church, food banks, elementary schools and hospitals) This gives them a sense of “giving back” and gets them out “doing something” plus connecting with the community. My friends also belong to gardening clubs, bridge clubs, and attend exercise groups. Generally speaking about twice a month they may have a dinner party at their home (on their meager food budget) - just to socialize. We also walk several times a week (some fast - some slow - some with walkers)…. inside the rec center if the weather is bad - outside enjoying on the sunny days.They may watch TV in the evenings (especially the news as they like to know what is going on in the world). Most go to bed fairly early (9pm), and they get up early (6am), Some tucker out about 2 pm and take a brief nap. There are sad times when someone falls ill or loses a spouse, but because they are connected to others = they support one another (and we get through it - life is always changing).The point of all this is that when retirement “HIT” - they made a new schedule of their days and activities - staying active - connecting with friends and family - plus finding new interests, friends, activities and hobbies… I am in my early 60’s and I hope to live a much longer life = by observing my so called elderly friends and seeing how alive and healthy they are - I see they have found the manner to continue a vital lifestyle clear into their 90’s and I hope to do the same.
