24 hours thinking each day. Waiting for that feeling, that special voice that says …this is it…go after this idea. Best if I relax and don’t try to think at all. Don’t rush and don’t worry. You just gotta know its coming…and it always does.10 minutes writing it down before I lose the idea. (I hate it when it happens as I fall asleep…cant tell you how many ideas I let go because I was too lazy to wake up)Seven days waiting for the structure of the language to develop…pondering the first seed corn.Then bang, I got more…from a source that I did not anticipate. (or I think so….in fact its just seed corn…but it's mostly all there.)About two weeks of on and off writing and correcting. Usually two hours a day …and I am mentally done. But I have to jump back in as new ideas arrive. Ideas for perfect titles of canto and chapters evolve to make my concept more clear (to myself).6 Months rewriting, adding new layer upon layer. Fleshing out the action and the language.About a year making corrections to my project. It is during this time the best language and ideas come up….a final sharpening of my idea and composition.Set it aside after I mock it up in a draft book.Then a few years later…rewriting it all again to make a good draft a work of art.Check it out : kosmoautikon.com
