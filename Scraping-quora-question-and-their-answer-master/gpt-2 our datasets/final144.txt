Working in a startup is always an adventure (well,I believe that) and if its your own then its never less than a roller coaster.While working on Campus Connect, our ed-tech startup. It was not just another working day. Each day you are growing,you are expanding operations,you are building something cool in tech,and off course you are burning a lot of money! A lot!So it counts! and as a Product and Growth Head each minute made a big deal for me.How many visits is it,What is the bounce rate,what is the average session period,Who are my users,Percentage of returning users,Time spent in each page,KYC details ufff,there is no end to that.I would begin @ morning 9 by checking my mails and replying for them.Grab something to eat from pantry,(Yes,we had)and check with slack channels.And then the big gun,Spend some quality time in Google Analytics - Note down important metrics.Welcome the other mates as they come(We had flexible timing too)Discuss what we did yesterday and What we need to do todayRead reviews,suggestions from users,write down things,prioritize features,have a word with others ,make decisions.LunchMeet with marketing,Growth team and discuss,discuss,discuss -- new ideas,campaigns,operational strategies,resource management.Meetings,Outlines,Calls.Spend quality time using our product.(I feel this as the most important thing as a product manager, spend time using your product)Have chat with tech team,about the stuffs we need to build next and how we are achieving that.And keep thinking how to improve, what to do next, How to do bla bla bla until sleep.
