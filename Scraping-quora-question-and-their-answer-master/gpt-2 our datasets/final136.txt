Not my parent,but grandma…the old bitch will wake up at 4 am and awake the whole household with her radio on a christian station,while singing at the top of her lungs and reading her bible and her religious books,not caring about any of us being tired,she does this even at sundays,when 5 am arrives,she goes to make her breakfast,then leaves her dirty plate and mug on the table and leaves to water her plants,wash her clothes and all that while mumbling about how she «makes everything at home without any help»,she wants all the house cleansing done at 6 am,including her plate and mug washed,or she will yell about how lazy we are,she spends the whole day sitting in her sofa listening to the radio,checking on her facebook,but the lunch can’t be prepared before she makes her own at 3 pm,so we pretty much g hunger or work based on snacks,otherwise ahe will throw a fit about how she will have to eat late because of us,because we are «slow»,she refuses to eat the food mom or I can cook,because we are «impish women,and she can’t allow her holy body to be contaminated through our food»,at 7 pm a pastor will arrive to make a service for another 7–10 old bitches just like grandma,when they leave,we clean their filthy disorder (a small supper must be served to them,funny how she eats the supper mom and I did for the group,because it was «purified by the pastor’s prays»),once the group leaves she will watch the news (no other tv show allowed at home,except for the news and christian shows,even though I paid for the huge screen) and finally go to sleep at 10 pm to start another similar day again at 4 am…oh,did I mention she is only 61?
