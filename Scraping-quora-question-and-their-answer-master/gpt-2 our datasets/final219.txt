Can only speak for myself. As a manfucatring engineer. This was the generic day:Come in and check production reports from last nightCheck emailsMeetingsTake care of my assigned production linesDocumentationProcess improvementsMore meetingsSupport new program launchesFix/improve production line with production / maintenance crewShoot the shit with the teamGo homeSome days have more boring things, some days are more hands on. It's a good balance imo if you like that type of work. I personally didn't like that life style so I opened my own 3D printing shop called Pineapple Systems. Here my days are much more hands on:EmailsBuild/design machinesDesign thingsMake improvements in the process and on clients productsMeetings with clientsSupport existing clientsBecome super frustrated because a machine worked flawlessly for months and one day it just decided to go on strike.BudgetInvest into equipment / marketing / etc.You get to wear a lot of hats when you own your own business and it's really satisfying. I think owning my own additivite manufacturing business advanced my skills as an engineer much more than my previous job but I think without my regular job I won't be able to do what I do today.
