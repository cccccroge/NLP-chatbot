What is a typical day of a liberal like?In the winter of 2006 I read a book, Time Travel in Einstein’s Universe by J. Richard Gott. It’s a pretty well written pop-science book where Gott describe work he did with a graduate student exploring the possibility of time travel via equations of General Relativity. There was a part of the book that has stuck with me over the years, and I think more people should take to heart.There is a scientific principle called the Copernican Principle, which really just means that there is nothing special about the location from which you make your observations. Gott highlights that by using this principle, you can make predictions about the future, specifically the longevity of things such as the Berlin Wall. He shares the story of visiting the wall in 1969 and making the prediction, based on the fact that there was nothing special about the point in time in which he was observing the wall, that there was a 50% that it would stand for another 2 2/3 and 24 years (for all the details on his prediction, see the book mentioned above). Sure enough, 20 years later the wall was torn down.So, what does this have to do with the “typical day of a liberal”? Well, I like to take the idea of the Copernican Principle to the extreme of assuming there is nothing special about me, or anyone else. When you take this view, you can draw some reasonable conclusions, such as the typical day of someone with opposing political views to you is probably not all that different from your typical day. A large number of people on a typical day will likely go to work, then go home and unwind before going to sleep. Sure, what you do for work might differ from what I do. The time you get out of bed and got to bed each day might differ, along with a lot of other minutia. But, believe it or not, people are largely the same.In fact, people today are not all that different from people thousands of years ago. In 79 CE, a volcano erupted covering the city of Pompeii is a thick layer of ash preserving the it as it was almost 2000 years ago. Graffiti has been found throughout the city and much of it amounts to, “So-and-so was here”, or penis and defecation jokes, in other words, the kind of stuff you’d find in almost any public restroom today. There is also this example: 2,500-year-old erotic graffiti found in unlikely setting on Aegean island.To summarize, we may have a difference on opinions on how to best achieve societal goals, but neither of us is special, and our day-to-day lives are likely more similar than different.
