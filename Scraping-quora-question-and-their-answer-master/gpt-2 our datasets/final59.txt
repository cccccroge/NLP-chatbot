The two officials confer with their party's congressional leaders about legislation being debated by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The vice president may then work at an office in the White House, the Executive Office Building, or the Senate wing of the Capitol. The vice president reads and answers mail and sees callers who have appointments. Tourists or unexpected visitors on emergency matters also may arrive. If the Senate is meeting that day, the vice president enters about noon to preside at the opening of the session. The vice president may remain at the session, depending on the nature of the day's business and the vice president's own schedule. If the vice president leaves, the presidentÂ  pro tempore or another senator takes over.The vice president spends many evenings away from home. The vice president must make various kinds of public appearances, many of which require speeches. The vice president may go to the airport to greet dignitaries from other nations. Ceremonial duties may require the vice president to dedicate a public-works project, open an athletic tournament, or present an award to the winner of a contest. Sources:some guy I met on the internet
