My momâ€™s typical day in assisted living was waking up in her cheery apartment and getting dressed to go down to the dining room for breakfast. The food was delicious! After breakfast she would look at the activity calendar and choose what she would participate in that day. Crafts, book club, bingo, a field trip, so many choices! Lunch was also served, and sometimes they would have someone come in to play piano and/ or sing. Somedays she would sit on the garden patio and chat with her friends. By dinner time, which was always something very tasty as well, things began to wind down. She still had the choice of doing something with her friends or retiring to her apartment to read or watch TV. She stayed in this place, calling it her home, until she died at 108. She was missed by staff and friends. Her last years were very happy there. All of us kids would come and get her for a day as well as spend the day with her there.
