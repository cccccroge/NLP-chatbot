See the sunlight peeking out and crawl out of bed. I usually take care of my “personal activities” and then go eat my breakfast. I gobble food down (cereal, pancakes and some fruits, vegetables) and quickly check my to do list for the day.I might just go out and do errands, groceries, hardware store, pharmacy, or some tenant might have something to take care of, and I have to call repair companies, or see if I can handle this in house. I do some paperwork and check rent and income and expenses and make sure I’m keeping records and if who, or what is causing problems.if I’m lucky and I don’t need to go or do anything, I’ll go online and try to write or promote my books and writing career. I’ll take a snack or lunch and usually something comes up and I have to deal with something. Even my family usually gives me work to deal with, and by the late afternoon, I await the working whines, when renters come with issues, that needs dealing or just whining.I’ll eat dinner and watch some tv (news- no Fox news) and or just watch jeopardy and/ or a movie from Netflix or some basic cable channel.I’ll read, maybe make to do lists, and usually workout for a good hour (weights, cardio, yoga) and try to end the night either catching up online(FB, my personal site, or just checking out my promotional plans) and then mediate before running to bed, and making sure the boogieman doesn’t get me.I wish it was more eventful or helpful but I’m pulled in many places and time runs so fast.Why I don’t like sleeping…
