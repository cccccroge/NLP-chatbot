I find these questions very hard. First of all, there are so many ranges of narcissism it's very different from each one. The thing they seem to all have in common is their denial of the truth, pathological lying, defensiveness, love-bombing, and what I call “out of sight out of mind behavior.”Now if it's just a regular day where you work and come home and nothing else really happens, it can be fairly pleasant as long as you just go along with everything … don't bring up anything in the past, don't bring up any concerns you have today, or have for the future. If you don't talk about anything that's deep, your day will probably go just fine. And you may have fun. Remember even been miserable couples have happy moments.other than that, if you bring anything up they don't want to talk about, they will continue to deny things which will cause frustration arguments, you'll either get hollered at if you're lucky, or if you're unlucky , you get the silent treatment. If your kids involved, he will yell at the kids probably about nothing because now you've made him mad and then he will blame you for yelling at the kids because it's your fault because you made him mad.( this did not happen in my situation, as we did not have kids together, he never tried to yell at my kids. But he had kids with ex-wife, and this was a frequent situation)Your day can go from perfect to bad in about one second, with one question. Sometimes it just depends on what you want to do that day. And mostly it's easier to shut your face.
