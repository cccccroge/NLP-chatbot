It feels like hell…When you’re out with his friends that he’s trying to impress, you’re primed with what to say and not say so he can keep up his facade, his lies. You uncomfortably agree and go along with it. After all, you’re his soul mate, right?He anticipates that you’re about to deviate from his instructions and finds a way to slither into the background to flail his arms around like a madman so you shut your mouth. Friends sit there, baffled, because you stopped mid-sentence with this weird look on your face. You’re in disbelief. You can’t believe a grown, older man (15 years your senior) would behave this way — in public, no less — and here you’re seeing it with your own eyes… and can’t believe you’re putting up with him treating you this way.You overhear him talking with his friends and referring to you like you’re his servant, “I’ll have her make lunch for us,” while you sit there and say to yourself, “Did I just hear that correctly?” And it’s a good thing that you did overhear it, otherwise there’d be no lunch for his friends because he doesn’t tell you of his plans — which would give him another excuse to make you look like the ass in front of them.There’s no real conversation between the two of you. He knows everything and you know nothing. Somehow if you agree with him on a particular topic, he changes his point of view so that you’re made to feel wrong again. As a result, you just learn to not say much at all.He agrees to do something fun that you love to do, but not happily. You sense his contempt in the air and end the activity abruptly, maybe saying that you’re tired or all of a sudden don’t feel good, so you avoid feeling even crappier just because you wanted to do something that you love and enjoy for a change.You go on vacation with him because that’s what you do in normal relationships, but you’re not really “with him”. There’s always that someone/a supply/someone he’s chosen to triangulate you with that he has to call to impress because he’s taken you on a vacation and they need to know how much “fun we’re having” three and four and five times a day… a phone call to the same person that many times… while you’re walking the beach… alone… because you just can’t stand listening to his BS. It makes your skin crawl… and you want to cry.He takes you to wine country because you enjoy wine… and it’s a great couple’s trip… all the while he’s complaining to his friends that you’re an alcoholic… you’re not. He participates in the wine-tastings, resentfully. After all, he’s a beer drinker.You hear the dinging of a text message coming in. You don’t know who it’s from and you don’t question it, but you see him deleting it from his phone as he glances over at you to see if you’re paying attention. He blasts out that it was from his son. And yet, he takes great pride in not deleting even one email he receives. Does he really think you’d believe he’d delete a text from his son?You see traces of an ex here and another ex there… him staying in contact with another ex’s daughter and giving her money… seeing with your own eyes someone else’s wife hopping into his lap… and not dare question it because you know it will turn into an all-out war. You eventually get up the nerve to say something because you’re so absolutely pissed, but none of these things happened and you’re just the jealous, insecure one -- even though HIS friends see and question these very same crazy things, too.“And the meek shall inherit the earth,” he blurts out for some strange reason, which then follows with: “One day, I’m gonna inherit the earth… because God said so and I’m so meek.” And yet, he openly mocks organized religion because it’s all about mind control. You ask yourself, “Should I laugh? Is he trying to be funny?” “Is he making fun of me?”Now as the curtain’s about to close on the final act, he sits there and boldly laughs in your face while you’re upset because all of a sudden you’re being left out of everything and not knowing why. You obeyed his every command, you kept your mouth shut to not make waves, you did all the things he wanted you to do. After all, you didn’t want HIM walking on eggshells… because that’s what HE told YOU he didn’t want when the relationship first started… He’s obviously been down this road before.
