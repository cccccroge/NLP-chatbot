Just want to share my own typical day at work:Around 9.00 (more or less 10 minutes), arrive in the office. Check email, skype, slack, telegram to see if there's something urgent to work on.9.10 discuss with my PM on what we (the team) are trying to achieve today.9.20 depends on the situation. If I have some urgent problem to fix or there are many things to do or we're facing deadline, I'll put my headphones and work straight away. However, there are occasions where the work for a day is not very demanding. In this case, I'll take my time to read news, or chat with my friends on whatsapp until 10.10.00 productive work*.12.00 lunch, and depending on the day, I either read manga online, watch YouTube, or update my fantasy football team.13.00 productive work*.15.30 short break, usually I take a snack and do little chat on whatsapp.15.45, intense coding, I have to finish today target.Between 17.30-18.30 I report my work today to PM via telegram, and then go home. Sometimes with satisfied mind, but more often with head full of things I want to tackle tomorrow.* productive work: coding, discuss wireframe/logic with coworkers,Â  review and fix bug, make/review documentation of previous work, explain things to PM about why additional requirement comes from client is feasible/not feasible, reply emails (when there is urgent bug), etc.
