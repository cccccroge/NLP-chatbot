We wake up, kiss our spouse on the forehead and head to the bathroom for a shower, shave. We brush our teeth and head for the kitchen to make the coffee, a quick breakfast of toast or an egg, and sometimes a few slices of citrus or fruit.We read a bit of CNN and compare that with FNN, MSN, MSNBC, and sometimes Breitbart. We check our email, say our goodbyes to the spouse and head out on our commute to the job.On the way out, if it is either Trash Day or Recycle Day, we will take the respective containers to the end of the driveway or curb.We get to the office, turn on the Computer, fix our Coffee while it comes on, and then start our daily grind.We correspond, order, release for production, schedule, coordinate, conference, catalog, update, edit, and generally put in our daily ration of endeavors to earn our daily bread.Lunch, pending what left-overs are in the fridge, is either from the microwave in the break area, from a local deli, Fast Food Restaurant, or Pizza Shop. Anyone that can get you served in 15 minutes or less. Small talk usually consists of how foolish the people appear in Congress, and why on Earth do we keep voting them into office. This conversation applies to all Parties, and that shoe fits just about any Politician that has been in Congress for more than 3 terms. When talking State legislatures, the only thing different is that they are “State Legislature”, term Limits is a universal concept regardless of State or Federal Levels.At the end of the day, we pack-up our things, shut down our stations and head home for the day. Sometimes we stop at a local “Watering Hole” for an Adult Beverage, sometimes we have to stop at a store for some item of necessity needed for dinner. Sometimes we have other appointments such as Doctor or Dentist appointments, Children who need to get to and from Dance Lessons, Karate Lessons, Track Meets, Soccer Practice, Homework Parties, School Dances or simply a Chaperone, Scout Meetings, Shooting Range Time, Cycling, or other normal everyday activities most other Citizens do on a daily basis.Once we are back home, we take the Trash or Recycle containers back to their respective positions. Being tired and full of the day's events, we will take some time to relax with our loved ones, prepare and eat our dinner, interact with our Kids, and on occasion watch some TV News. Most of us do not follow Talk Show Editorials like Anderson 360, Cuomo, Carlson Tucker, and the myriad of other Talk Shows that do nothing but give an opinion on what the News is.Our weekends are similar to every other typical American Citizen, we mow our Grass, do our Laundry, talk to our neighbors, mess with our cars, Hobbies, etc. Many of us have Charitable causes we contribute our free time to such as Youth Sports, Church Charities, food drives, Volunteer Fire Hall Fund Raisers, Girl Scout Cookie Sales, Boy Scout Activities such as Camping, Conservation, Crafts, First Aid Skills, and general good social skills that are best taught by example which we try and do to the best we are able.On Sundays (Saturday for a few), as a general rule, many Conservatives of many Religious Doctrines attend their House of Worship. And we attempt to follow the doctrine of our Faith, and many feel empathy for those who were Martyred for the sake of their Faith and Convictions, and have malice toward none.As the last day of rest before returning to their work on Monday morning, we sometimes gather with some friends, neighbors, colleagues, and others to converse, debate, and generally have a relaxing time with people within our sphere. And on other occasions simply stay in for the evening and enjoy private time with family.Our days are no different than any other person.Reading the other comments really showed me several important things;The people commenting are not only uneducated in what a Conservative means, but they are also unkind, unfair, and they are also mostly dishonest in what they depict a Conservative to be.They are Lemmings that use the talking points that originate from someone else who also have closed minds and do not have the intellectual strength to use their own mind to make a decision on what being Conservative is about.To a handful of Commenters:Either you are very versed in Sarcasm, or you actually believe what you have written.Sarcasm is making a joke out of the question, which I took to be a sincere question. If sarcasm was the purpose, the job well done.If they were not sarcasm, then you folks have a real issue with reality as nothing most have stated is in any way a depiction of what reality is. And with that said, I feel sorry for you folks. Such intellectual weakness should not exist within folks who claim to be Progressive or Liberal.
