I will tell you about my mom-in-law because I had the distinct opportunity and pleasure to spend a great deal of time with her.She had suffered a stroke at home that had left her weak in her right side and had messed up her speech. The only ones who could communicate with her were my husband and myself. Somehow, I always could tell what she was thinking.IThe weakness in her left side became much better but her speech didn't return. Her boys traded off days staying with her at night. My husband would go by on his way home from work and eat supper with her every night. Just to make sure she ate. My husband would take her shopping on Fridays, his day off, I told him to let her pick out the meat she wanted and I would cook it and have it ready for him to take to her so all she would need to do would be to put it in the microwave and heat it.Then I started taking her shopping. My husband hates shopping! The sooner he's out, the better!With me, she could take as much time as she needed. We spent lots of time doing just that, shopping for her groceries. Shopping at our local mall. We would go visit people, any time she wanted. We even cleaned out her flower bed and mulched it. It looked brand new! She loved her flower bed.She would go out there and pull weeds out of it after we finished it and that's when her hip broke. The doctor, who had been taking care of her for many years said from the look of the break, she fell after the hip broke.She truly never regained full use of that hip. Something was wrong from the beginning.She had been extremely active before that time. Now, it was very painful. and something wasn't working right.To cut to the end of the story, she was ready to be in Heaven with her one and only love, my father-in-law.
