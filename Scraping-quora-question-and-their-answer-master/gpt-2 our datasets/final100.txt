The big difference between working for a hedge fund and working for a securities house on the sell-side is accountability and concomitant risk. At a hedge fund, a professional is definitively on the hook for your decisions and recommendations. This is compounded by the fact that often, the roles of an analyst and portfolio manager are combined at a hedge fund, whereas most players in a securities house are in an agency position, as analysts providing stock calls and analysis to external clients and to internal salesmen. Sure, the securities houses folk are on the hook, but they aren't beholden to possible investor redemptions and the ire and possible volatility of the principals of the hedge fund. I've seen at least two situations where two or more high profile bad investments were associated with job termination. However, there are certainly instances where principals of a failed hedge fund have gone on to launch new funds, along with instances where hedge fund principals have continued to be highly remunerated for average performance.On the face of it, this suggests a greater degree of job stress and security at a hedge fund. But ask any securities house employee this question and you will almost certainly get the opposite answer as the sell-side continues to engage in lay-offs and job insecurity remains rife. A key differentiator between the hedge fund and sell-side role stems from the difference between customer and provider. The hedge fund customer can call upon the knowledge, models and views of multiple providers, particularly in an over-brokered market. This is invaluable in allowing him or her to understand market expectations around a given security and thus where there is room for surprise and outperformance.
