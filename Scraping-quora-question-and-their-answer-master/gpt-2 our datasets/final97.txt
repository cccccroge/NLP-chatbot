Background: $50Bn AUM Fund. Generalist covering non-North American companies from Canada. Long-only with avg. 8 year holding periods. I no longer work at this fund but this was how my “typical” day was structured.Timeline in day:5:30am rise. I like to train at the gym in the afternoon so I get in the office to accommodate. Morning journaling once I rise.6:00am - 6:30am. Arrive at office. 10- minute walk. morning coffee. meditation if needed.6:30am to 3:30pm ~ 6:30pm. Work. I’m a competitive powerlifter of 10 years so I’ll leave at around 4:30pm on most training days to go to the gym. Other colleagues who compete as well (i.e. mountain bike, triathlon) will go train throughout day or some do early mornings and come in later. If I have calls with Asian companies at night (7pm to 10pm) then I’ll leave early to gym, eat and then prep the calls at home.Work:Time split is usually:60% Learning30% Thinking10% ExecutingLearning:Speaking with management, customers, suppliers, competitors on phone. Some scuttlebutt interviews with easily available sources in-person as well (i.e. speak to property manager of our office to understand that business and relate that to what it’s like in Japanese market).Reading annual reports. Past 5 years on average but even longer if needed.Watching videos and reading industry reports on facets of the industryRarely speak with sell-side, don’t look at quarterlies, use Bloomberg maybe 5 minutes in a day.Read books on financial history, autobiographies of business moguls, human psychology. We have a firm library where everyone reads a ton and we discuss them periodically.Thinking:Stare off into space and think about what people are missingDraw large maps of industry value chains to find an edgemeetings with colleagues to flush out ideas and thought. Killing ideas asap and finding blindsides.Executing:Weekly meeting to decide if we want to trim positions or add a bit. Mere countermeasure against doing any needless actions throughout rest of week.Initiate a position if idea is solid in opinion of everyone on team. PM will usually take a few days to think it over after initial pitch. Depends on fund but on average there are 2 - 4 initiations in a year.I can’t emphasize enough how much of the day is just reading, talking and thinking.On my career podcast, Accounted For, I also interview another hedge fund investor and we have a candid conversation about the industry. We talk about what this individual’s day is like and the realities of the job that the media misses on.
