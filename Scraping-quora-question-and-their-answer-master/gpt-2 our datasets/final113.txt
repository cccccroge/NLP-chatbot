On a typical day, a liberal wakes up late and gets pissed off watching CNN while he brushes his teeth. CNN had yet another expose of some imaginary bad things that Trump has done such as lowering taxes, He takes his first anti depression pill of the day washing it down with coffee. He rushes to the train and reads the NYTimes on his commute, and that really pisses him off, because, like the CNN morning news, there are lots of stories exposing Trump as a very bad man rolling back all the progress liberals have made to improve life in places like Detroit and Chicago’s SW side. Once at work, the liberal turns on his computer and goes right back to CNN and gets very pissed off because, guess what?, CNN has found even more horrible things that Trump has done in the past 80 minutes. There’s a story how the EPA can no longer force farmers to stop irrigating their fields with stored up rainwater. The liberal stops by another liberal’s office on the way to coffee to commiserate about how DT was probably having sex with interns in the Oval Office. After a hard day, catching up with articles in ‘Nation Magazine”, the liberal takes another happy pill and gets back on the train and listens to a talk radio show which makes his blood boil because someone like Rush was warning about terrorists, while everybody knows Islam is “the religion of peace”. Rush even had the nerve to ask how the Clintons and 0’Bamas got so filthy stinking rich! At home, his liberal wife complains about their deplorable plumber who had the nerve to charge them $105.73 for two hours of work with his crew unstopping their showers and a toilet. She bets the guy has a MAGA sticker on his truck but was afraid to look. That evening, they watch Chris Matthews and Rachel Maddow, and that gets them so mad, they have trouble sleeping. Maddow had their heads exploding over the North Korean’s offer to meet while suspending his rocket and bomb programs. They still can’t sleep and take an extra dose of sleep medication.
