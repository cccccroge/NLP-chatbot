I’m a conservative even though I was apparently temporarily insane (or perhaps more accurately - politically immature) in 1976 when I voted for Jimmy Carter. Reagan sowed my conservative roots deep and I’ve voted conservative ever since because I believe that conservative values and principles are generally more rational and practical than liberal ideology.My day as a conservative? I work a full-time job as a dentist, so I’m up at 5:30 AM, at work at 7:00 AM, and injecting local anesthetic by 7:30 AM. I work a full 8-hour day and am usually headed for home at 4:30 PM. I rarely talk politics at work, and I treat everyone who walks through the door like I would family.On my lunch break I surf the news from many different sources: Google News, USA Today, BBC, Fox News, and Bloomberg. I listen to Dennis Prager’s radio talk show one hour a day because he makes such good common sense.I don’t push my political views on others and I rarely talk politics as it is too divisive. I look for common ground in conversations. I do a lot of listening. I like to complement coworkers for jobs well done.At home I eat early and and am out in my garden and yard until dark. Sometimes I walk or go fishing. I exercise a bit. After dark, I might stargaze and wonder at the beauty and immensity of the heavens.I may watch some evening tv. I like Laura Ingraham’s show. Yes, she’s pro-Trump, but she’s honest about it and passionate about her opinions. I like that. I rarely will watch MSNBC or CNN because I consider them anti-conservative, anti-republican, anti-Christian, and anti-Trump. As a result, I consider them highly biased in their reporting of the news. They are pushing a viscious agenda against Trump, wanting to take him down. This is not the job of news organizations. Their objectivity has been completely sacrificed to their liberal agenda.I personally do not like President Trump as a person. I think he’s crude, often insulting, and does not comport himself with presidential decorum. I do support his conservative policies however. I don’t like the manner in which he operates at a personal level. He’s too egotistical and vain. I think he’s a hard man to like.I talk with my wife in the evenings. We discuss our family mostly, some current events. I read a variety of books before bed each night. I love history books about contemporary history and historical fiction.And before I close my eyes, I read some scripture and pray. I pray for myself, my family, my sick friends and family, my country and my President.I go to church on Sundays to worship and connect with fellow Christians. I often watch or listen to Bible studies throughout the week on You-Tube or downloaded MP 3 files.We live relatively short lives, 70–80 years on average, and we will all die. The grave is everyone’s common destination. My goal in life is to hear my Saviour tell me “Well done good and faithful servant.”, so I try to conduct my life in a manner that reflects my goal. I try to be kind, I donate to causes that help the disabled and less fortunate. I always evaluate my actions and behaviors each and every day. I confess my shortcomings, my sins, and I ask forgiveness to those I may have wronged.I’m far from perfect - very far. But I know what I’m striving for, I know my purpose in life, so I try each day to fulfill my purpose through good works, kind words, and loving others as best I can, no matter their race, color, or other differences.I live and let live. I have enough trouble managing my own emotions and actions, so who am I to tell someone else how to live or what to think. If they ask me my opinion, I’ll gladly share it, but I don’t push it. I avoid divisive conflict whenever I can, but am not afraid to share my views. I strive to live a quite and peaceful life.I love my wife and family, and I strive to conduct myself so that they might respect what I am doing . Life can be frustrating. I mess up. I lose my temper at times. I get angry. I apologize to those I’ve hurt by my actions. They usually forgive me.So that’s my day. I’m not devoted to conservatism activism. I simply choose to live a conservative life because it suits me. Others might call it boring; I call it fulfilling my purpose as a Christian first, a family man second, and a conservative, third.James Koenig
