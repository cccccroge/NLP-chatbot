First report is given between shifts. If the patient is known to the oncoming nurse report can be brief. The typical duties include patient assessments vital signs, accuchecks and giving meds. These can be interrupted by a change in the patient which requires the nurse to notify the doctor. The PCT may report a change in a patient's condition, so the nurse needs to drop what she's doing and go check. Some patients need extra time to take their meds. Perhaps they need them crushed and mixed with food such as applesauce, or given through a feeding tube. Call lights need to be answered. Incontinent patients need to be washed and their bedding changed. Often patients need help getting out of bed, rolling over in bed and getting on and off the toilet. The nurse may need a 2nd person to help. Coworkers may be at the desk or they may all be busy which makes it harder to find a helper. Family members often want to talk with the nurse. Sometimes a rounding doctor wants to talk to the nurse caring for his patient. This is just some highlights and by no means a complete list of the things nurses do on a typical day. On an exceptional day the nurse has time to pet. On a more exceptional day the nurse has time to eat. It is not unusual for a nurse to work twelve or more hours without taking a break or eating. Staffing guidelines are outdated and don't reflect cureent patient acquity and son according to the numbers staffing is adequate. A common interrupter to the nurse's routine is getting a new admission.
