It’s the basics.My wife wakes me up, brushes my teeth and makes my breakfast. I’ll read my bible and pray for the gays while drinking my black coffee. My wife polishes my gun for that day while I get dressed.I give my wife her shoes for the morning drive to take my daughter to her Baptist elementary school. I head to the office while listening to Fox News on satellite radio in my american truck with a gun rack in it.I go into work and make sure all the affairs at work are appropriately covered up. I then check the security camera at home to ensure my wife’s shoes have been put back up. She is at work in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant again with our six month old on her hip. Just 4 more months until our #6. She is making full fat cookies for the fundraiser to stop abortions at church tonight.Back at work, I’m sexually harassing my secretary and listening to Glenn Beck, then call my wife and tell her to check our disaster rations. She sighs as she does not want to go down to the bunker. She does it anyway as she does not want to disobey me again.Now it’s time to turn up the Bose system and light up my cigar for the Rush Limbaugh program. I then call up Token, my one African American friend and find out why other people of their race speak so badly.I then eat a giant sandwich from Hardee’s and make sexist comments to my coworkers about Danika Patric of Indy Car racing. I chug a beer and head to the shooting range. I fire 8 or 9 guns and go back to work and meet with my stock broker. I buy more gold.I listen to Sean Hannity. I do an interview and ask the candidate why they went without a job for six months and assert that it was the Mexican who stole their job. I hire him immediately and go to the lobby to let the Indian and Guatemalan women know that I just hired the man as he had “the look.”I text my wife and let her know that I am on my way so she can put my dinner on the table. I then get home and put my feet up and drink a scotch. I then wonder over to the table to complain about the liberals - especially Pocahontas. I then spend the last half of the meal correcting my daughter about why we don’t call transgender people by the sex they want to be. I also tell her that gay people must be deprogrammed.I then send my daughter to bed and have my wife pleasure me and then she asks about my newest STD and I assure her it’s just a new assistant.We then go to bed and get drunk while my wife cries herself to sleep.—Okay that is all false. I do try to follow the Pence rule but I also keep a big wall between work and personal lives. I deeply love my wife and daughter- she does attend a Christian school but the kids are taught to love all and that all are forgiven.My wife does a lot of volunteering- she was able to stop working when my daughter was born. She was a big deal with a national healthcare charity so now she volunteers. This is her choice.I work on a Mac (no we’re not banned from Apple products). I am a creative and do creative management. I’ve worked with a ton of liberals and have never had a problem with them except for the week of the last election.I’ve never hit my wife nor do I even drink.We’re normal people but it is fun to pretend to be the example that everyone pushes!EDIT: I must add to my seriousness part that we have many African Americans as friends and we even have one in our family. My wife’s best friend growing up is one of the top drag queens in Boston. We love everyone!
