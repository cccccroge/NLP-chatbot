DinnerGrowing up, I was excited for dinner because it meant tasty, home-cooked food with my family. Occasionally we’d watch a movie together though most days, we talked about our days. Plus it was fun to have that mystery. What’s mom making next? That smell of beef in the air…is it stroganoff, pot-roast or something new?As an adult, I still look forward to it. I love cooking and I’m excited to try new recipes. Throughout the day I may wonder what to cook, pondering between recipes. Or if I use the slow-cooker, I think about the tasty meal waiting for me once I come home. And of course, I still see my family and we do have dinners together when I visit. We still laugh and talk over tasty food. I may be coming into my own as a cook but there’s nothing quite like my mother’s meals.
