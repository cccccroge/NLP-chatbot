I am a 4th year phd student working in natural language processing. Unlike some previous answers, I have found my schedule to become more consistent once I was done with courses, mainly because I had more control over my time. My typical day lasts from about 9 am to 7 pm. I have three kinds of days:1. Related work study days: On these days I tend to spend a lot of time reading papers in my area. I might try to implement some of the algorithms I find and try them on my data.2. Research days: On these days I tend to spend a lot of time analyzing my data and building prototype systems. These days are much more focused than type 1.3. Peripheral days: These days are all about knocking out small tasks such as fixing issues on our publicly maintained systems and corpora.Now that I've written this, I think most days are a mixture of these three with type 1 and type 3 being more dominant further from paper deadlines and 2 being almost 100% dominant close to paper submission deadlines. Of course, some days are just unproductive, but you learn to minimize those with time :)
