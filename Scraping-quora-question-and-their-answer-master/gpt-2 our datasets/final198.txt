The Paris Review has been interviewing celebrated authors for decades. The typical picture: 2–4 hours writing/day plus 2–4 hours reading/day, about 6 hours total.If you’re talking novelists, most (=not the famous ones) have day jobs.There are websites that detail the working habits of different famous authors. If you’re interested in writing, it might be fun to “try on” the daily habits of each of your favorite writers for a few days. Who knows? Maybe one will suit you perfectly!Good luck. :)
