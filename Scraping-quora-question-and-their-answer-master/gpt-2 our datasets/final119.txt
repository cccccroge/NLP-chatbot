Typical day…. hmmm…I usually wake up between 5–6 am. I typically sleep 3–4 hours a night. This time of year, I go sit on the back deck and watch the deer.I come inside around 6:30 am and turn on my computer. Around 6:45 Domenic will log online and we’ll spend a few minutes seeing how the other is doing. While I wait for him to log on, I check my email to see if there is anything urgent I need to attend to.About 7 am I make a pot of coffee. I don’t drink the stuff, but dad does, so I like to have it ready for him now. He used to wake up early as well… now it’s anywhere from 7:30 - 9 am before he wakes up. Once it brews, I toss out the filter so it doesn’t drip and make the coffee even more bitter.I get dressed, brush my teeth, and then grab something to eat as I get started working. This summer, I seem to have developed a preference for blueberries, so more often than not, I just grab a bowl and put some blueberries in it and munch on them as I start working.Between 7:30–8 am my workday begins. (Except on Tuesdays)On any given workday I’ll have anywhere from 2–5 meetings, either on Skype, Zoom, or phone with clients. I’ll go through a couple hundred emails, which I make sure I respond to all before my day ends.I handle whatever needs my clients have, wait for answers, etc.Without fail, when I am talking to a client, Hobbs (cat) decides he needs to begin opening cabinet doors. So I hear…. bum..bum..bum…bum…bum as he opens the doors and they shut. It’s irksome. The cat is 3 years old… this is a trick he’s learned in the last few months.It goes on until I say, “Hobbs… knock it off.” Then he stops.I check on dad and see how he’s doing. More and more often he’s staying inside and sleeping through the day. If he feels up to it, then he’ll go outside and putter around.I work until 5pm… I rarely do lunch. I then fix dinner, do dishes, and at times I’m on quora… other times I surf the net.Right now, I’m trying to learn about solar power and decide what system I want to convert to (I’m building a new house on the property). I can use the panels or I can put shingles on the roof that are solar. I need to learn what size backup I need, the meter I need, etc. I’ll have to decide by the end of the year.Dad wants a pond… he wants to just walk out there to fish instead of going the mile and a half to the lake.That impacts how deep the pond needs to be, the grade, the type of fish I need, and do I just drop a tree in the bottom for the fish to hide or do I put plants such as water lilies in? These are things I need to figure out.On Tuesdays, I work in the evenings after I come home from spending the day at the foodbank.On weekends… I clean house, run errands, and if dad hasn’t done it, then I mow the yard. The yard is actually about 5 acres that we keep cut… keeps snakes from around the house. I don’t do well with snakes.I spend time throughout the week and on the weekends as I can talking to my group to plan the project we want to launch by October… hopefully we’ll have all in place.Our goal is to help establish 100 cottage industry businesses in this area to help people find a way to make extra money… or help them start their own business. Once we help them get going, then we need to find more people than we currently have to help us teach them how to be business owners and how to grow their business.If we’re able to launch this successfully here, then we will try other communities to do this in.Off and on, I hop on facebook and post things I find interesting… I love the weird science videos… things I find humorous, or anything I can think of to torment my kids. At times I post… “I’m waiting to hear from my child that has not bothered to call me lately. You know which one you are… and just what do you have to say for yourself?”I then laugh as all 6 of them start calling trying to explain why they haven’t called or to complain that they have called.It’s the perk of being mom.I’m a newsie… so I read online papers at times when waiting, or have the TV on news. If I hear something, I typically google it online to see if more than one place is reporting that.All of these plans go out the window on days dad is having a bad day.If he’s not doing well… I put it all aside and sit and talk with him or suggest a road trip where I drive… he tells me stories of his time in the airforce or when he was a kid.At 9 pm Domenic calls… we’ll have spent an hour or so on Skype at some point in the evening talking. He calls me every night, and we talk. Dad will be in bed or asleep in his recliner.I talk to Domenic for 30 - 45 minutes.Then I sleep when I can and begin again.This is how us shameful liberals spend our time.
