I hang out with pretty much a group of engineers that consists of:Industrial, Material, Software/Firmware, Hardware I can give you a long list of them, but here is what pattern we all share in common:Task driven day: To finish projects requirements have to be met, I would say in most of the engineering fields the milestones are reached depending on a group of tasks and that can be a bless or sometimes a curse. So you might end early, or spend extra time looking into finding solutions. Extra curricular activities:  Being interested in other fields, which makes the day exciting by  spending time on things less important rather the engineering field we  are in, infact 2 hours ago I was asking about what computer engineers  could possible do if technology is not overwhelming enough for them.Fine arts :) : Spending sometime out of work looking into either:QuoraRedditHacker NewsReading web comics or Imgur (Imgur is a big part of this bunch that I know :) ).Online gaming also can be something some of them do (Okay maybe not during work)Documentations: I don't know what your current career is, so I can try to resonate the information, but for me and my computer engineer group, we spend a good chunk of the day reading through documentations and learning about new things, it's a big part of the day.
