I do not know about IIM A but being a student from IIM B, I can assure you that it is pretty hectic. Once you reach IIM, the seniors are keen to interact with you and profs would try to grill you. Club selections, sports team selections, resume preparation for summers etc. etc. are the tasks in hand and these take a lot of time. But again, academics is important as well. You neglect a quiz, u end up at the bottom of the class. Every class is case based and one has to prepare well for the class. Weightage is given to Class Partcipation as well.
