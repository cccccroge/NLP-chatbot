Very few problems have been solved in physics during the past 4 generations. A vast number of unexplained phenomena have been observed, but not much in the way of problem solving.One big mystery has been how did those huge galactic sized black holes form so early in the universe. Obviously star mass collapse could not have done it since some billion solar mass black holes are known to have existed prior to stars in some of those galaxies.Recent simulation work has concluded that those black holes did in fact form during a process involving rapid dark matter halo formation. That is great. One step forward. Something better than knowing nothing. Of course we still do not know what dark matter is, or how it assembles into those halos, but at least we know now that the dark matter is responsible for the formation of the first super massive black holes all across the galaxy.That simulation probably took 10 years to program, so that is what physicists do 99 percent of the time. Create theories, models, simulations, and see how well the models and simulations agree with reality observed through telescopes. When something works, the results are published, and sometimes exiting results like the simulation I just described appear on popular news site.
