My day involves following at Intel: Checking lots of images to see there are no defects. Writing computer programs to get, process, analyze data and make conclusions out of them. Create various statistical plots throughout the day to derive conclusions out of them. Create settings on the tools so that the engineering tools run in a certain way to give the most optimum performance that maximizes production, improves quality and output.Â  Train other engineers on how to use various software, or engineering tools. Create reports so that managers can review them, and suggest more projects. Organize various plans for multiple engineering projects throughout the day. Keep the sustenance items moving. A typical good engineer should focus on the following items for their workplace: Enhance friends of production; that is, make an impact on the items that improve the value of a company. Or reduce enemies of production; that is make an impact on the items that reduce the value of a company. From various resources read on Harvard Business Review, I created a really nice list for myself, that may help engineers in various other fields. Stay blessed, and stay inspired!
