We are bootstrapping and this is the third month. Its a tech product - in the enterprise analytics space - web based and has three co-founders and two interns. We have a collective experience of 20 years (min -6 , max-7). This is our experience from a typical working day.I wake up by 9 - have a good breakfast - hit the office - which is a makeshift arrangement in the living room where two other co-founders(living under the same roof) and the interns turn up by 10.We have a checkpoint to begin with regarding the day's tasks and leftovers from the day before. We start working immediately ( The idea is to get to productivity asap - we even have a rule of no TC, no HN, no reddit , no Twitter in the first three hours of work).We have a lunch break around 2 - we go off the boil, play ping pong, listen to loud insane music, read some TC gossip, and get back to work by 45 minutes from the start of lunchWe work through the afternoon - mostly coding, discussing use cases, writing test cases, enhancing mockups, pushing into git and amazon, and working non-stop till sunset.We stay very conscious to stay on track and have a checkpoint at 7 in the evening to discuss the day's progress , collectively and individually. Interns leave at this point of time.We play more ping pong or watch England drubbing Australia in the latest Ashes, talk to girl friend(s), have dinner, read hn, tc, twitter etc., go for a Run, during this two and half hour break.We get back to work at 9:30 , and do stuff till 12. This is when we can choose to call it a day. Sometimes we go upto 1 A.M, in case we are stuck. Beyond 1 , we kick each other out of our systems since there is tomorrow coming up to be battled with.Earlier, while we were at our day-jobs, starting up had a lot of romanticism attached to it. Nowadays its just plain maniacal focus intended towards one and one thing - Shipping the product. Because that is where the game starts.EDIT: We are not funded, with our kind of industry background, we had enough money to bootstrap ourself to launch.
