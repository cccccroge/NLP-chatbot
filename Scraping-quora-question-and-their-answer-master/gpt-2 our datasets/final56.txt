I'm a new PhD student, here is what my routine's like:8:30 - wake up9:30 - go to class/your lab11:00 - get some work done, discuss stuff/problems with people12:00 - 1:00 - Lunch Time!1:00 - 6:00 - more classes, do your assignments, more work (maybe coding/reading/writing), meetings.6:00 - 10:00 - more work, maybe you wanna do something else for leisure10:00 - go home10:30 - 11:59 - go to bedi know its bad, most of the time i'm imprisoned in my lab. :) I think it also depends on what your professor expects from you, so you may adjust your time accordingly.
