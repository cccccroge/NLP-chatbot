I doubt I’m a typical liberal. I’m going to try to answer this sincerely though.I wake up, and take my thyroid, and tell Alexa to set a timer for 30 minutes. Do my various morning things that don’t bear repeating, and sit down and check the news on either my phone, if I’m doing poorly (I’m rather old and fully disabled, and live in elder housing), or sit at my computer and check there. Often I’ll be listening to NPR on the radio.When my Echo Dot tells me it’s a half hour, I take the next handful of pills for my epilepsy and vasculitis and the B and D vitamins and the entire set of confetti, along with a big glass of water, and set to breakfast because otherwise some of the pills tear up my gut, so even if I am not hungry, I’d best eat.Today, generic Cheerios and dried cranberries. I like cranberries better than raisins and they’re cheaper these days, but what that really means is that raisins have gotten expensive because of the California droughts, so it’s not really a good thing.Then if I am feeling well enough, I wash up dishes, but if not I leave be for later which is far too often.I spend a lot of time reading news, because I get paid to blog about it — to do analysis here and on G+ and Facebook, through Patreon. I could be fully retired since my stroke and such, and whatever money I get is docked from my disability until I get old enough for Social Security retirement, but I’d rather work — and besides, if I am working it’s less of a burden on the taxpayer.I had a 401K and savings, but when a drunk driver rear ended me, and I stroked out — before ObamaCare — I was forced to spend down all of it on medical bills, supporting my family, and so on, to get on public health as I could no longer keep my job, and I was the breadwinner. It was literally catastrophic. So now I live in poverty. But I still have my brain. I just am not well enough consistently to get an editor to hire me, and my bodily health is pretty much ruined.A few years back they had me on opiates, but thank God I had enough sense to wean myself off of them against advice. We know where that led. The philosophy then was that since I was never going to get better, I may as well be anesthetized. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t read, I couldn’t write — I was useless to anyone including myself. I am still an addict, I have no delusions on that account. I just don’t use. It was shortly after that that, in September 2015, that I set myself the goal to become a top writer on Quora in 15 months (by January 2017). To my great shock, I was named Top Writer in January 2016, after three months of concentrated effort.I live very modestly, except for my health under $1000/mo with no Food Stamps or any of that sort of thing, and my needs are very simple. I crochet and sew things which gets me presents for friends and things for myself.As a Top Writer on Quora (these three years now!), I am very grateful for my sub to the NY Times, and I splurge yearly for a sub for Foreign Policy, and the Washington Post (which is cheap as I am included on my Army vet son’s Amazon Prime). As a writer, I don’t subvert paywalls, although as a retired cybersecurity/national security analyst, I know how I could do so easily, but it wouldn’t be ethical, would it? But I spend a lot of my day reading and listening to podcasts in my areas of interest. I have no television — everything in on my computer or phone or tablet (all getting quite old, lol).I live in a studio apartment, about 400 sq ft or so, an efficiency kitchen. I sleep on a futon bed and have an ottoman that stashes the bedclothes, and I put a single size memory foam topper behind it and ratchet it up to a couch for visitors, who rarely come by. But I am blessed to be here, although it’s “the projects” and subsidized housing where I can’t get anything delivered because it will be ripped off.But when I am very ill, which happens, there is a nursing station on the floor. I wish I could live with family — I took care of my own mother for seven years, until her Parkinson’s and dementia was too much for her to stay at home, after dad was gone and she couldn’t be by herself — but there is only my son, and he is only 25 (I had him very late, and his father bailed on us when he was three months old with a woman ten years my junior). Like many young men, he is just not the caregiver type and often works 60 hour weeks and is single.And, I am in a location easy range to many of the great universities of our nation here in Boston, so when I have a good day, I can consult the lecture calendars and it is like the world is open to me. That may only be a few days in a month, but it is very special. It is like freeing a bird from her cage for an afternoon. I am former MIT staff, and still have friends in the area who are active in the tech and academic worlds, and I sometimes meet them for coffee, or they take me shopping and so on. It’s a pleasure to get out when I can.Mostly, I stay home though, and do quiet things. Read, write, cook, craft.I divide my writing among tasks such as trying to explain our country’s position in an international context, running watchdog on the beltway, analyzing complex technical and political issues, interpreting complex politics that don’t make it through as “soundbite” issues in mainstream media, decoding the newspeak that comes out of DC from either side of the aisle — and castigating liberals for their blinders regarding their own beams in their eyes vs specks in others. And that might surprise you, but we are never going to fix anything in this country as divided as we are today.Today — literally today — I was reading the news out of the UK regarding the recent poisoning of an ex-pat Russian spy and his daughter, and particularly the article in The Sun, which is Murdoch’s News Corp — essentially a tabloid which is May’s government’s Fox and Friends, if you will. And they had no end of casus belli intelligence and military leaks sounding like they were preparing conservatives in the UK for the swift conclusion that the poisoning was an act of war by Russia on their soil, and they would be calling on NATO to rally military action against Russia (perhaps in Eastern Europe, perhaps in the Middle East).More moderate papers in the UK reported that a confab of NATO authorities today met and were telling the press openly that they might not send representation to the World Cup in Russia. The rough equivalent of a strongly worded letter, hmm?And others of my sources told me that military recruiters around the country were told of a new program just today to encourage our troops to re-up their commitments for six years, for a $20,000 signing bonus. A four month program, they were told, to compensate for too-aggressive draw downs in the past.All these things do not bode well, put together, if you connect the dots.Because Trump’s base will not go against him — perhaps unless we are at war with Putin, and then Mueller shows collusion. Because nothing unifies a country like war.It made me feel rather ill, to be honest. But I’m quite sure it would be effective.I also corresponded with an old friend about talented and gifted education, spoke to a young man I’m mentoring in Romania about ethics, chatted with my son online (he lives six blocks away but works very hard in biotech in a job related to his Army training), and planned to go to a farmer’s market with my best friend tomorrow if I’m well enough.And I made myself a salad for dinner from tinned dollar-store mackerel, tinned peas, Ro-Tel tomatoes, diced sweet onion, and ranch dressing. I’ll have plenty for lunch and maybe dinner tomorrow. Very cheap, and quite nutritious.And that buffers the evening confetti of pills. I’ll likely play a bit of my little farm game, Farm Together, before bed, and listen to podcasts.I am not a typical liberal, and this was not necessarily a typical day for me. But I’m not sure I have a typical day. My life is full of contradictions.Perhaps you should post to ask what a typical day was for conservatives, and see if you get as interesting answers?
