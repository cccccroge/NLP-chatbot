First of all it DEPENDS on person to person branch to branch and even hostel to hostel there is no specific routinebut you already know that.Life of GHOT:Wake upStudySleepLife of LITE:Wake upProcrastinateSleepLife of the Real BITSIANS//No points neededWake up after a nightmare which reminded you of filling OMR wrongly in Advanced.Shaking it off and beginning the day.10 minutes to class but still somehow miraculosly getting ready and reaching LTC well before time. Making no notes just understanding the concepts and enjoying learning until your crush walks in looking as cute as ever, just admiring her and being lost in another world but then coming back to class(Yes you still need to study in college)Then walking out of LTC and seeing the artistry of Rayleigh Scattering. Gathering up the courage to ask the crush out , taking her to Skylab, having the most awesome conversation but then remembering that Chem Lab began 5 minutes ago. Running so fast with a hope that it will make time slow down, borrowing the labcoat of a random outsider and then barging into the Lab, head filled with millions of excuses but this is BITS Pilani we are talking about here excuses are nothing but a tool of the incompetent. In other words marks deducted for late arrival(Sad!).Teary Eyed returning back only to greeted by friends with Lite Le!. Sometime later laughing with wingies while eating the most disgusting food in mess.Going for club work/department work/Sport Team work or just doing anything which one likes . Getting back tired, exhausted but still going to Library so as to study for the tut test tomorrow. Returning back at midnight , going to ANC eating your favorite burger with your favorite people. Heading back to room and sleeping with a dream of A7 and a nightmare of JEESo this is what a BITSian day is like we study, love, flirt, run, beg, cry, laugh, work,regret, enjoy, and most importantly live each day.
