I don’t think I’ve ever had a typical day…Let me ask a more philosophical question. What is the most efficient way to produce inspiration on a regular basis?I honestly don’t know, but I’d conjecture that having a “typical day” and falling into a particular routine does not produce a whole lot of inspiration. And inspiration is the one fuel you’re always looking for when you’re doing a PhD. It’s what moves you forward…The rest of time, you’re basically stuck in a metaphorical hamster wheel. You will feel compelled to run on that hamster wheel non-stop like all the other hamsters you see around you. There are always more things to get done in a given day than you actually have time to do. And so you will run, run, run.Yet if you stop running, you will notice that you haven’t really gone anywhere. Also, interestingly enough, the world doesn’t end when you stop running. But shh…don’t tell any of the other hamsters that…If you just focus on the running, you will probably eventually burn out and drop out of the PhD program. If you stop running, you’ll lose all that kinetic energy you had, and it will similarly be difficult to continue with your PhD.So the only way to avoid both of these traps is to reach a state where you’ve gotten so used to running, that for moments at a time you forget you’re running, and your mind can wander to some other place. It is during this elevated state of consciousness, that you hope inspiration will enter you and help you finish your PhD.Everything outside of your moments of inspiration should blur together. You know you must have woken up at some point, and you must have gone to sleep at some point, and hopefully you’ve had at least a meal or two in-between that time. But the details aren’t really that important.And so a typical day is pretty much null, meaningless, just more running on the hamster wheel, but that’s the last thing you want to think about. What you’re really just hoping is that when inspiration finally hits you, it will spread like fire with all the energy you’ve built up.
