There is never a typical day but your passion will keep you going for about 18 hours per day try and cut down on two days per week.Find a partner you trust and a mentor that you can bounce ideas off.Be pro-active and trust your gut instincts they will usually be right.Don't send e-mails late at night and certainly have someone check over your documents before sending them.Diaries and post-it notes in whatever form along with a day book will serve you well.Most of all enjoy the ups and downs and try and spend sometime each day in reflection.
