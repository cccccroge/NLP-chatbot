I'm near the end of my first year, and our school is in the midst of a curriculum shift.  Many medical schools are going to an active learning environment, which means that traditional lectures are less common.  Here's an average course schedule for me:Monday through Thursday8:00 AM - 12:00 PM -  lectures       We get a 10 minute break between each hour.  I live 30 minutes from school so I'm up by 6:45 or 7:00 each morning12:00 PM - 1:00 PM - lunch1:00 PM - 7:00 PM - studying       This study period might include either reviewing lecture material or watching online lectures on new topics.  Some of our material is learned independently through either textbooks or lecture videos made by faculty.7:00 PM - 8:30 PM - travel home and dinner    after I get home I can take care of stuff like laundry and getting a little downtime, so it's not too badFridays8:00 AM - 10:00 AM - Clinical medicine class and physical exam lab     This class runs all year and teaches us the basic skills of the patient history and physical exam.  We will be reinforcing these skills throughout med school, but it starts in first year.12:30 PM - 4:00 PM - clinical precepting     We get paired with a family practice doc to work on our exam skills.  In my case, I see patients with my preceptor at his office, so I'm getting patient contact from the beginning (which I love).4:00 PM - 8:00 PM - studyNow, this schedule will change with courses that have a lab component, and when exams are coming up.  Especially when exams are nearby, I spend a LOT more time at school studying.
