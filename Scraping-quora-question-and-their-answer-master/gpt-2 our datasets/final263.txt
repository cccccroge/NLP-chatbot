This is a pretty difficult question to be answered, sorry for the delay.There is no particular incident that I can recall right now that changed my normal day/life. But yes, there was definitely a phase where I kept doing nothing, being lazy all day, not spending time with friends, no physical fitness, no extra activities, just stuck up with my daily routine busy with academics.After few days I started feeling annoyed of being so useless, I wasnâ€™t able to concentrate on my work, my performance declined, and yes it traumatized me.It was then I decided to change my normal routine, The first thing I decided was to wake up early in the morning and go for a walk. Morning air is fresh and full of oxygen and this air refreshed my body and mind. I enjoy the beauty of nature, the smell of flowers and the chirping sound of birds, It brings a smile on my face when I see the kids play during their holidays, when I watch the young couple exercise together, when I watch old people do their yoga.This also helps me melt my stress away when I feel worn down and it is said that as your body releases endorphins, you begin to shed your feelings of stress and improve your confidence, it gets easier to be more outgoing with those around you.Thus I started spending more time with my cousins and friends rather than spending my time alone in a room with my cell phone and laptop. Ofcourse it was comforting to curl up on the couch and enjoy a bowl of ice cream, but a part of me is guilty for wasting my time like that. That helped me gain nothing other than body weight :PSome things that really helped me:Going for a morning walk not only helps me with physical fitness, it also helps me meet new people, and make new friends and play with the pets around.Getting out of my room leaving the social networking sites behind for some time helps me get a good hearty laugh with my best buddies when we hang out together.Reading good books give me a lot of new ideas.Going out on trips/picnic with family and friends brings the little hidden kid out of me.I have plenty of people that have made a difference in my life and I carry some part of them with me.sorry for the long answer, but there are many such small things that helped me out and made this answer so long
