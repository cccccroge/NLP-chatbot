This thread has been pretty tech person focused, so I'll give the non-technical POV. It's also a little bit slower with things in product development and our startup being in such early stages.Wake up, check email. Respond to emails that I can get off my plate and usually there are about 3 "things" I need to do myself from that morning batch. Do those things.Go eat lunch. Try to schedule that lunch to be with an investor, entrepreneur or some other network connection that will be beneficial.Drive to Ann Arbor (30-40 min commute). Fit in most communication with family into these drives. Get to co-working space, catch up on email/things dropped on plate. Check in with team members.Figure out the best way to add value to the company. In the very earliest stages, there's not as much that's "OH CRAP I NEED TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW". To be sure there's some but it's not as often as in the startups people are talking about in this thread. After I've taken care of all the "need to do" I do a lot of writing. I blog frequently, write on Quora, tweet (for the company), and email people who have signed up with us. I also do a ton of networking. Basically, I do anything and everything that will a) develop relationships with potential customers and b) support product development as much as I possibly can. I typically find that it gets to be 8 or 9PM and then I realize "Oh wait...I need to eat dinner..." and then go eat. Then there's often a design meeting at around 10PM some nights and I do that while eating or after. Then I either meet with my cofounder for one reason or another or head home. I spend some time with my girlfriend and then before I go to sleep I do some more work or do a lesson or two in Think Python (trying to learn to program in Python).
